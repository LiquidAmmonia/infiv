### Reinforced Attention Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04884v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04884v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04884v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04884v1)

Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.
  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.

### CoWTracker: Tracking by Warping instead of Correlation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04877v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04877v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04877v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04877v1)

Dense point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from video analysis to robotic manipulation. State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.

### PerpetualWonder: Long-Horizon Action-Conditioned 4D Scene Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04876v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04876v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04876v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04876v1)

2026/02/04 18:58 GTM

We introduce PerpetualWonder, a hybrid generative simulator that enables long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image. Current works fail at this task because their physical state is decoupled from their visual representation, which prevents generative refinements to update the underlying physics for subsequent interactions. PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both the dynamics and appearance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that from a single image, PerpetualWonder can successfully simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions, maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.

### Laminating Representation Autoencoders for Efficient Diffusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04873v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04873v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04873v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04873v1)

Recent work has shown that diffusion models can generate high-quality images by operating directly on SSL patch features rather than pixel-space latents. However, the dense patch grids from encoders like DINOv2 contain significant redundancy, making diffusion needlessly expensive. We introduce FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses this representation into a one-dimensional sequence of just 32 continuous tokens -an 8x reduction in sequence length and 48x compression in total dimensionality. On ImageNet 256x256, a DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves a gFID of 1.80 with classifier-free guidance while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to diffusion on uncompressed DINOv2 features. These are preliminary results and this work is in progress.

### When LLaVA Meets Objects: Token Composition for Vision-Language-Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04864v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04864v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04864v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04864v1)

Current autoregressive Vision Language Models (VLMs) usually rely on a large number of visual tokens to represent images, resulting in a need for more compute especially at inference time. To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.

### PDF-HR: Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04851v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04851v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04851v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04851v1)

Pose and motion priors play a crucial role in humanoid robotics. Although such priors have been widely studied in human motion recovery (HMR) domain with a range of models, their adoption for humanoid robots remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data. In this work, we introduce Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots (PDF-HR), a lightweight prior that represents the robot pose distribution as a continuous and differentiable manifold. Given an arbitrary pose, PDF-HR predicts its distance to a large corpus of retargeted robot poses, yielding a smooth measure of pose plausibility that is well suited for optimization and control. PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines. Code and models will be released.

### LitS: A novel Neighborhood Descriptor for Point Clouds
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04838v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04838v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04838v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04838v1)

2026/02/04 18:31 GTM

With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, with applications that span across various scientific and technological fields. Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.

### It's not a Lottery, it's a Race: Understanding How Gradient Descent Adapts the Network's Capacity to the Task
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04832v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04832v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04832v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04832v1)

Our theoretical understanding of neural networks is lagging behind their empirical success. One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.

### Toward Reliable and Explainable Nail Disease Classification: Leveraging Adversarial Training and Grad-CAM Visualization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04820v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04820v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04820v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04820v1)

Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.

### XtraLight-MedMamba for Classification of Neoplastic Tubular Adenomas
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04819v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04819v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04819v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04819v1)

Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.

### X2HDR: HDR Image Generation in a Perceptually Uniform Space
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04814v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04814v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04814v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04814v1)

2026/02/04 17:59 GTM

High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.

### VISTA-Bench: Do Vision-Language Models Really Understand Visualized Text as Well as Pure Text?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04802v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04802v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04802v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04802v1)

2026/02/04 17:48 GTM

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels. The source dataset is available at https://github.com/QingAnLiu/VISTA-Bench.

### Light Forcing: Accelerating Autoregressive Video Diffusion via Sparse Attention
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04789v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04789v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04789v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04789v1)

2026/02/04 17:41 GTM

Advanced autoregressive (AR) video generation models have improved visual fidelity and interactivity, but the quadratic complexity of attention remains a primary bottleneck for efficient deployment. While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textsc{Light Forcing}, the \textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\eg, $1.2{\sim}1.3\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\times$ speedup and 19.7\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}.

### Generative Modeling via Drifting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04770v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04770v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04770v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04770v1)

2026/02/04 17:06 GTM

Generative modeling can be formulated as learning a mapping f such that its pushforward distribution matches the data distribution. The pushforward behavior can be carried out iteratively at inference time, for example in diffusion and flow-based models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Drifting Models, which evolve the pushforward distribution during training and naturally admit one-step inference. We introduce a drifting field that governs the sample movement and achieves equilibrium when the distributions match. This leads to a training objective that allows the neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution. In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space. We hope that our work opens up new opportunities for high-quality one-step generation.

### Mitigating Long-Tail Bias via Prompt-Controlled Diffusion Augmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04749v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04749v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04749v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04749v1)

Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery is critical for urban mapping and land-cover monitoring, yet training data typically exhibits severe long-tailed pixel imbalance. In the dataset LoveDA, this challenge is compounded by an explicit Urban/Rural split with distinct appearance and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains. We present a prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework that synthesizes paired label--image samples with explicit control of both domain and semantic composition. Stage~A uses a domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate layouts that satisfy user-specified class-ratio targets while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage~B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance. Mixing the resulting ratio and domain-controlled synthetic pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization, demonstrating controllable augmentation as a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation. Source codes, pretrained models, and synthetic datasets are available at \href{https://github.com/Buddhi19/SyntheticGen.git}{Github}

### How to rewrite the stars: Mapping your orchard over time through constellations of fruits
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04722v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04722v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04722v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04722v1)

Following crop growth through the vegetative cycle allows farmers to predict fruit setting and yield in early stages, but it is a laborious and non-scalable task if performed by a human who has to manually measure fruit sizes with a caliper or dendrometers. In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.

### Adaptive Prompt Elicitation for Text-to-Image Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04713v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04713v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04713v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04713v1)

2026/02/04 16:24 GTM

Aligning text-to-image generation with user intent remains challenging, for users who provide ambiguous inputs and struggle with model idiosyncrasies. We propose Adaptive Prompt Elicitation (APE), a technique that adaptively asks visual queries to help users refine prompts without extensive writing. Our technical contribution is a formulation of interactive intent inference under an information-theoretic framework. APE represents latent intent as interpretable feature requirements using language model priors, adaptively generates visual queries, and compiles elicited requirements into effective prompts. Evaluation on IDEA-Bench and DesignBench shows that APE achieves stronger alignment with improved efficiency. A user study with challenging user-defined tasks demonstrates 19.8% higher alignment without workload overhead. Our work contributes a principled approach to prompting that, for general users, offers an effective and efficient complement to the prevailing prompt-based interaction paradigm with text-to-image models.

### SAR-RAG: ATR Visual Question Answering by Semantic Search, Retrieval, and MLLM Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04712v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04712v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04712v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04712v1)

2026/02/04 16:23 GTM

We present a visual-context image retrieval-augmented generation (ImageRAG) assisted AI agent for automatic target recognition (ATR) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.

### Annotation Free Spacecraft Detection and Segmentation using Vision Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04699v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04699v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04699v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04699v1)

2026/02/04 16:07 GTM

Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-world zero-shot visual recognition. However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points. Code and models are available at https://github.com/giddyyupp/annotation-free-spacecraft-segmentation.

### DRMOT: A Dataset and Framework for RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04692v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04692v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04692v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04692v1)

2026/02/04 15:56 GTM

Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Text-to-image generative models have made remarkable progress in producing high-quality visual content from textual descriptions, yet concerns remain about how they represent social groups. While characteristics like gender and race have received increasing attention, disability representations remain underexplored. This study investigates how people with disabilities are represented in AI-generated images by analyzing outputs from Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 using a structured prompt design. We analyze disability representations by comparing image similarities between generic disability prompts and prompts referring to specific disability categories. Moreover, we evaluate how mitigation strategies influence disability portrayals, with a focus on assessing affective framing through sentiment polarity analysis, combining both automatic and human evaluation. Our findings reveal persistent representational imbalances and highlight the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of generative models to foster more diverse and inclusive portrayals of disability.

### REDistill: Robust Estimator Distillation for Balancing Robustness and Efficiency
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04677v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04677v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04677v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04677v1)

Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student by aligning their predictive distributions. However, conventional KD formulations - typically based on Kullback-Leibler divergence - assume that the teacher provides reliable soft targets. In practice, teacher predictions are often noisy or overconfident, and existing correction-based approaches rely on ad-hoc heuristics and extensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders generalization. We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures. Remarkably, it achieves these gains without model-specific hyper-parameter tuning, underscoring its robustness and strong generalization to unseen teacher-student pairs.

### AGILE: Hand-Object Interaction Reconstruction from Video via Agentic Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04672v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04672v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04672v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04672v1)

Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

### PIO-FVLM: Rethinking Training-Free Visual Token Reduction for VLM Acceleration from an Inference-Objective Perspective
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04657v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04657v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04657v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04657v1)

Recently, reducing redundant visual tokens in vision-language models (VLMs) to accelerate VLM inference has emerged as a hot topic. However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead. Our code is available at https://github.com/ocy1/PIO-FVLM.

### A labeled dataset of simulated phlebotomy procedures for medical AI: polygon annotations for object detection and human-object interaction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04624v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04624v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04624v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04624v1)

This data article presents a dataset of 11,884 labeled images documenting a simulated blood extraction (phlebotomy) procedure performed on a training arm. Images were extracted from high-definition videos recorded under controlled conditions and curated to reduce redundancy using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) filtering. An automated face-anonymization step was applied to all videos prior to frame selection. Each image contains polygon annotations for five medically relevant classes: syringe, rubber band, disinfectant wipe, gloves, and training arm. The annotations were exported in a segmentation format compatible with modern object detection frameworks (e.g., YOLOv8), ensuring broad usability. This dataset is partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) subsets and is designed to advance research in medical training automation and human-object interaction. It enables multiple applications, including phlebotomy tool detection, procedural step recognition, workflow analysis, conformance checking, and the development of educational systems that provide structured feedback to medical trainees. The data and accompanying label files are publicly available on Zenodo.

### ImmuVis: Hyperconvolutional Foundation Model for Imaging Mass Cytometry
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04585v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04585v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04585v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04585v1)

We present ImmuVis, an efficient convolutional foundation model for imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a high-throughput multiplex imaging technology that handles molecular marker measurements as image channels and enables large-scale spatial tissue profiling. Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling.

### SalFormer360: a transformer-based saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04584v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04584v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04584v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04584v1)

Saliency estimation has received growing attention in recent years due to its importance in a wide range of applications. In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our model achieves 8.4% higher performance on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous state-of-the-art.

### PEPR: Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization for Domain Generalization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04583v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04583v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04583v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04583v1)

Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which poses a critical challenge for real-world deployment under conditions that differ from the training data. To address this domain generalization challenge, we propose a cross-modal framework under the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm for training a robust, single-modality RGB model. We leverage event cameras as a source of privileged information, available only during training. The two modalities exhibit complementary characteristics: the RGB stream is semantically dense but domain-dependent, whereas the event stream is sparse yet more domain-invariant. Direct feature alignment between them is therefore suboptimal, as it forces the RGB encoder to mimic the sparse event representation, thereby losing semantic detail. To overcome this, we introduce Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), which reframes LUPI as a predictive problem in a shared latent space. Instead of enforcing direct cross-modal alignment, we train the RGB encoder with PEPR to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness. The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation.

### Understanding Degradation with Vision Language Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04565v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04565v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04565v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04565v1)

Understanding visual degradations is a critical yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone. We also introduce \textbf{DU-110k}, a large-scale dataset comprising 110,000 clean-degraded pairs with grounded physical annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms generalist baselines in both accuracy and robustness, exhibiting generalization to unseen distributions.

### Nix and Fix: Targeting 1000x Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting with Diffusion Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04549v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04549v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04549v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04549v1)

2026/02/04 13:39 GTM

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) revolutionized novel view rendering. Instead of inferring from dense spatial points, as implicit representations do, 3DGS uses sparse Gaussians. This enables real-time performance but increases space requirements, hindering applications such as immersive communication. 3DGS compression emerged as a field aimed at alleviating this issue. While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates, down to 0.1 MB, and towards 1000x rate improvement over 3DGS at comparable perceptual performance. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

### OmniRad: A Radiological Foundation Model for Multi-Task Medical Image Analysis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04547v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04547v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04547v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04547v1)

2026/02/04 13:38 GTM

Radiological analysis increasingly benefits from pretrained visual representations that can support heterogeneous downstream tasks across imaging modalities. In this work, we introduce OmniRad, a self-supervised radiological foundation model pretrained on 1.2 million medical images, designed with radiology-inspired principles emphasizing representation reuse and cross-task transferability. We evaluate the pretrained encoder under multiple downstream adaptation regimes, including lightweight task-specific adapters with a frozen backbone as well as full end-to-end fine-tuning for classification, allowing us to assess both representation quality and task-specific performance. OmniRad is evaluated on a broad suite of public benchmarks spanning classification and segmentation across multiple modalities. On the MedMNISTv2 collection, OmniRad improves classification F1 by up to 2.05% over competing foundation models. For dense prediction, OmniRad attains mean Dice score improvements across six MedSegBench datasets when using frozen representations. Qualitative analyses and latent-space visualizations suggest improved feature clustering and modality-related separation.

### SLUM-i: Semi-supervised Learning for Urban Mapping of Informal Settlements and Data Quality Benchmarking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04525v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04525v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04525v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04525v1)

2026/02/04 13:16 GTM

Rapid urban expansion has fueled the growth of informal settlements in major cities of low- and middle-income countries, with Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan and Mumbai in India serving as prominent examples. However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.

### S-MUSt3R: Sliding Multi-view 3D Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04517v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04517v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04517v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04517v1)

The recent paradigm shift in 3D vision led to the rise of foundation models with remarkable capabilities in 3D perception from uncalibrated images. However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. This work proposes S-MUSt3R, a simple and efficient pipeline that extends the limits of foundation models for monocular 3D reconstruction. Our approach addresses the scalability bottleneck of foundation models through a simple strategy of sequence segmentation followed by segment alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without model retraining, we benefit from remarkable 3D reconstruction capacities of MUSt3R model and achieve trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods with more complex architecture. We evaluate S-MUSt3R on TUM, 7-Scenes and proprietary robot navigation datasets and show that S-MUSt3R runs successfully on long RGB sequences and produces accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging the MUSt3R model for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, with an important advantage of making predictions directly in the metric space.

### EgoActor: Grounding Task Planning into Spatial-aware Egocentric Actions for Humanoid Robots via Visual-Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04515v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04515v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04515v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04515v1)

2026/02/04 13:04 GTM

Deploying humanoid robots in real-world settings is fundamentally challenging, as it demands tight integration of perception, locomotion, and manipulation under partial-information observations and dynamically changing environments. As well as transitioning robustly between sub-tasks of different types. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a novel task - EgoActing, which requires directly grounding high-level instructions into various, precise, spatially aware humanoid actions. We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.

### Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning for Multi-modal Large Language Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04476v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04476v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04476v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04476v1)

2026/02/04 12:04 GTM

Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.

### SALAD-Pan: Sensor-Agnostic Latent Adaptive Diffusion for Pan-Sharpening
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04473v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04473v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04473v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04473v1)

Recently, diffusion models bring novel insights for Pan-sharpening and notably boost fusion precision. However, most existing models perform diffusion in the pixel space and train distinct models for different multispectral (MS) imagery, suffering from high latency and sensor-specific limitations. In this paper, we present SALAD-Pan, a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening. Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.

### Temporal Slowness in Central Vision Drives Semantic Object Learning

Humans acquire semantic object representations from egocentric visual streams with minimal supervision. Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.

### Seg-ReSearch: Segmentation with Interleaved Reasoning and External Search
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04454v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04454v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04454v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04454v1)

2026/02/04 11:33 GTM

Segmentation based on language has been a popular topic in computer vision. While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/Seg-ReSearch.

### SynthVerse: A Large-Scale Diverse Synthetic Dataset for Point Tracking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04441v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04441v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04441v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04441v1)

Point tracking aims to follow visual points through complex motion, occlusion, and viewpoint changes, and has advanced rapidly with modern foundation models. Yet progress toward general point tracking remains constrained by limited high-quality data, as existing datasets often provide insufficient diversity and imperfect trajectory annotations. To this end, we introduce SynthVerse, a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for point tracking. SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking. In addition, we establish a highly diverse point tracking benchmark to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art methods under broader domain shifts. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that training with SynthVerse yields consistent improvements in generalization and reveal limitations of existing trackers under diverse settings.

### TrajVG: 3D Trajectory-Coupled Visual Geometry Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04439v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04439v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04439v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04439v1)

Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models often degrade on videos with object motion. Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.

### Med-MMFL: A Multimodal Federated Learning Benchmark in Healthcare
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04416v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04416v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04416v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04416v1)

Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized medical institutions while preserving data privacy. However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences.

Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system formed by agents and their environment through active perception, embodied cognition, and action interaction. Existing embodied AI remains confined to human-crafted setting, in which agents are trained on given memory and construct models for given tasks, enabling fixed embodiments to interact with relatively static environments. Such methods fail in in-the-wild setting characterized by variable embodiments and dynamic open environments. This paper introduces self-evolving embodied AI, a new paradigm in which agents operate based on their changing state and environment with memory self-updating, task self-switching, environment self-prediction, embodiment self-adaptation, and model self-evolution, aiming to achieve continually adaptive intelligence with autonomous evolution. Specifically, we present the definition, framework, components, and mechanisms of self-evolving embodied AI, systematically review state-of-the-art works for realized components, discuss practical applications, and point out future research directions. We believe that self-evolving embodied AI enables agents to autonomously learn and interact with environments in a human-like manner and provide a new perspective toward general artificial intelligence.

### LCUDiff: Latent Capacity Upgrade Diffusion for Faithful Human Body Restoration

Existing methods for restoring degraded human-centric images often struggle with insufficient fidelity, particularly in human body restoration (HBR). Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency. The code and model will be at https://github.com/gobunu/LCUDiff.

### Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba for Multi-Modal Image Fusion

Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to combine images from different modalities to produce fused images, retaining texture details and preserving significant information. Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM.

### Quantile Transfer for Reliable Operating Point Selection in Visual Place Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04401v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04401v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04401v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04401v1)

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a key component for localisation in GNSS-denied environments, but its performance critically depends on selecting an image matching threshold (operating point) that balances precision and recall. Thresholds are typically hand-tuned offline for a specific environment and fixed during deployment, leading to degraded performance under environmental change. We propose a method that, given a user-defined precision requirement, automatically selects the operating point of a VPR system to maximise recall. The method uses a small calibration traversal with known correspondences and transfers thresholds to deployment via quantile normalisation of similarity score distributions. This quantile transfer ensures that thresholds remain stable across calibration sizes and query subsets, making the method robust to sampling variability. Experiments with multiple state-of-the-art VPR techniques and datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering up to 25% higher recall in high-precision operating regimes. The method eliminates manual tuning by adapting to new environments and generalising across operating conditions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

### Enabling Real-Time Colonoscopic Polyp Segmentation on Commodity CPUs via Ultra-Lightweight Architecture

Early detection of colorectal cancer hinges on real-time, accurate polyp identification and resection. Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings. This work provides not only a CPU-native solution for colonoscopy but also a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications. Source code is publicly available to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future benchmarking.

### SparVAR: Exploring Sparsity in Visual AutoRegressive Modeling for Training-Free Acceleration
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04361v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04361v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04361v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04361v1)

Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\mathbf{> 5\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\mathbf{1.57\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\mathbf{2.28\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality. Code is available at https://github.com/CAS-CLab/SparVAR.

### When and Where to Attack? Stage-wise Attention-Guided Adversarial Attack on Large Vision Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04356v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04356v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04356v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04356v1)

Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.

### VecSet-Edit: Unleashing Pre-trained LRM for Mesh Editing from Single Image

3D editing has emerged as a critical research area to provide users with flexible control over 3D assets. While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information. More details can be found in our project page: https://github.com/BlueDyee/VecSet-Edit/tree/main

### Finding NeMO: A Geometry-Aware Representation of Template Views for Few-Shot Perception

2026/02/04 09:12 GTM

We present Neural Memory Object (NeMO), a novel object-centric representation that can be used to detect, segment and estimate the 6DoF pose of objects unseen during training using RGB images. Our method consists of an encoder that requires only a few RGB template views depicting an object to generate a sparse object-like point cloud using a learned UDF containing semantic and geometric information. Next, a decoder takes the object encoding together with a query image to generate a variety of dense predictions. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can be used for few-shot object perception without requiring any camera-specific parameters or retraining on target data. Our proposed concept of outsourcing object information in a NeMO and using a single network for multiple perception tasks enhances interaction with novel objects, improving scalability and efficiency by enabling quick object onboarding without retraining or extensive pre-processing. We report competitive and state-of-the-art results on various datasets and perception tasks of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating the versatility of our approach. https://github.com/DLR-RM/nemo

### Explicit Uncertainty Modeling for Active CLIP Adaptation with Dual Prompt Tuning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04340v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04340v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04340v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04340v1)

Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.

### Fine-tuning Pre-trained Vision-Language Models in a Human-Annotation-Free Manner

Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, but adapting them to downstream tasks typically requires costly labeled data. Existing unsupervised self-training methods rely on pseudo-labeling, yet often suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples. We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over existing unsupervised methods and even few-shot supervised baselines.

### Multiview Self-Representation Learning across Heterogeneous Views

Features of the same sample generated by different pretrained models often exhibit inherently distinct feature distributions because of discrepancies in the model pretraining objectives or architectures. Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

### JOintGS: Joint Optimization of Cameras, Bodies and 3D Gaussians for In-the-Wild Monocular Reconstruction

Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos remains challenging, particularly in unconstrained in-the-wild scenarios where camera parameters and human poses from off-the-shelf methods (e.g., COLMAP, HMR2.0) are often inaccurate. Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering. Notably, our method shows significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to the baseline.Our source code is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/JOintGS.

### GeneralVLA: Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning

Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

### Beyond Static Cropping: Layer-Adaptive Visual Localization and Decoding Enhancement

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.

### Light Up Your Face: A Physically Consistent Dataset and Diffusion Model for Face Fill-Light Enhancement
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04300v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04300v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04300v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04300v1)

Face fill-light enhancement (FFE) brightens underexposed faces by adding virtual fill light while keeping the original scene illumination and background unchanged. Most face relighting methods aim to reshape overall lighting, which can suppress the input illumination or modify the entire scene, leading to foreground-background inconsistency and mismatching practical FFE needs. To support scalable learning, we introduce LightYourFace-160K (LYF-160K), a large-scale paired dataset built with a physically consistent renderer that injects a disk-shaped area fill light controlled by six disentangled factors, producing 160K before-and-after pairs. We first pretrain a physics-aware lighting prompt (PALP) that embeds the 6D parameters into conditioning tokens, using an auxiliary planar-light reconstruction objective. Building on a pretrained diffusion backbone, we then train a fill-light diffusion (FiLitDiff), an efficient one-step model conditioned on physically grounded lighting codes, enabling controllable and high-fidelity fill lighting at low computational cost. Experiments on held-out paired sets demonstrate strong perceptual quality and competitive full-reference metrics, while better preserving background illumination. The dataset and model will be at https://github.com/gobunu/Light-Up-Your-Face.

### SkeletonGaussian: Editable 4D Generation through Gaussian Skeletonization

4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

### KVSmooth: Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Key-Value Smoothing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04268v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04268v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04268v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04268v1)

Despite the significant progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, hallucination -- corresponding to the generation of visually inconsistent objects, attributes, or relations -- remains a major obstacle to their reliable deployment. Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.
  To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.
  Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously. In contrast, prior methods often improve one at the expense of the other, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

### Decoupled Hierarchical Distillation for Multimodal Emotion Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04260v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04260v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04260v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04260v1)

Human multimodal emotion recognition (MER) seeks to infer human emotions by integrating information from language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations. This hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3\%/2.4\% (ACC$_7$), 1.3\%/1.9\% (ACC$_2$) and 1.9\%/1.8\% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI dataset, respectively. Meanwhile, visualization results reveal that both the graph edges and dictionary activations in DHMD exhibit meaningful distribution patterns across modality-irrelevant/-exclusive feature spaces.

### Depth-Guided Metric-Aware Temporal Consistency for Monocular Video Human Mesh Recovery

Monocular video human mesh recovery faces fundamental challenges in maintaining metric consistency and temporal stability due to inherent depth ambiguities and scale uncertainties. While existing methods rely primarily on RGB features and temporal smoothing, they struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. We propose a comprehensive depth-guided framework that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through three synergistic components: A Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; A Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator that leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; A Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module that enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues. Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.

### Towards Next-Generation SLAM: A Survey on 3DGS-SLAM Focusing on Performance, Robustness, and Future Directions

Traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems often face limitations including coarse rendering quality, insufficient recovery of scene details, and poor robustness in dynamic environments. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its efficient explicit representation and high-quality rendering capabilities, offers a new reconstruction paradigm for SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews key technical approaches for integrating 3DGS with SLAM. We analyze performance optimization of representative methods across four critical dimensions: rendering quality, tracking accuracy, reconstruction speed, and memory consumption, delving into their design principles and breakthroughs. Furthermore, we examine methods for enhancing the robustness of 3DGS-SLAM in complex environments such as motion blur and dynamic environments. Finally, we discuss future challenges and development trends in this area. This survey aims to provide a technical reference for researchers and foster the development of next-generation SLAM systems characterized by high fidelity, efficiency, and robustness.

### SPOT-Occ: Sparse Prototype-guided Transformer for Camera-based 3D Occupancy Prediction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04240v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04240v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04240v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04240v1)

Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.
  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc.

### An Improved Boosted DC Algorithm for Nonsmooth Functions with Applications in Image Recovery

We propose a new approach to perform the boosted difference of convex functions algorithm (BDCA) on non-smooth and non-convex problems involving the difference of convex (DC) functions. The recently proposed BDCA uses an extrapolation step from the point computed by the classical DC algorithm (DCA) via a line search procedure in a descent direction to get an additional decrease of the objective function and accelerate the convergence of DCA. However, when the first function in DC decomposition is non-smooth, the direction computed by BDCA can be ascent and a monotone line search cannot be performed. In this work, we proposed a monotone improved boosted difference of convex functions algorithm (IBDCA) for certain types of non-smooth DC programs, namely those that can be formulated as the difference of a possibly non-smooth function and a smooth one. We show that any cluster point of the sequence generated by IBDCA is a critical point of the problem under consideration and that the corresponding objective value is monotonically decreasing and convergent. We also present the global convergence and the convergent rate under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. The applications of IBDCA in image recovery show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The corresponding numerical experiments demonstrate that our IBDCA outperforms DCA and other state-of-the-art DC methods in both computational time and number of iterations.

### Reinforced Attention Learning

Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.
  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.

### Rethinking the Trust Region in LLM Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04879v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04879v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04879v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04879v1)

Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.

### Subliminal Effects in Your Data: A General Mechanism via Log-Linearity

Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.
  We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.

### CoT is Not the Chain of Truth: An Empirical Internal Analysis of Reasoning LLMs for Fake News Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04856v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04856v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04856v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04856v1)

From generating headlines to fabricating news, the Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically assessed by their final outputs, under the safety assumption that a refusal response signifies safe reasoning throughout the entire process. Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.

### Decomposed Prompting Does Not Fix Knowledge Gaps, But Helps Models Say "I Don't Know"
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04853v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04853v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04853v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04853v1)

Large language models often struggle to recognize their knowledge limits in closed-book question answering, leading to confident hallucinations. While decomposed prompting is typically used to improve accuracy, we investigate its impact on reliability. We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning. Our results show that disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty baselines as an error detector, improving both F1 and AUROC across settings. This demonstrates that decomposition-based prompting can serve as a practical diagnostic probe for model reliability in closed-book QA.

### Horizon-LM: A RAM-Centric Architecture for LLM Training
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04816v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04816v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04816v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04816v1)

2026/02/04 18:04 GTM

The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.

### SE-Bench: Benchmarking Self-Evolution with Knowledge Internalization

True self-evolution requires agents to act as lifelong learners that internalize novel experiences to solve future problems. However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring "Closed-Book Training" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.

### OmniSIFT: Modality-Asymmetric Token Compression for Efficient Omni-modal Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04804v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04804v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04804v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04804v1)

2026/02/04 17:51 GTM

Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.

### Speaker-Aware Simulation Improves Conversational Speech Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04776v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04776v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04776v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04776v1)

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational speech remains challenging due to the limited availability of large-scale, well-annotated multi-speaker dialogue data and the complex temporal dynamics of natural interactions. Speaker-aware simulated conversations (SASC) offer an effective data augmentation strategy by transforming single-speaker recordings into realistic multi-speaker dialogues. However, prior work has primarily focused on English data, leaving questions about the applicability to lower-resource languages. In this paper, we adapt and implement the SASC framework for Hungarian conversational ASR. We further propose C-SASC, an extended variant that incorporates pause modeling conditioned on utterance duration, enabling a more faithful representation of local temporal dependencies observed in human conversation while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of the original approach. We generate synthetic Hungarian dialogues from the BEA-Large corpus and combine them with real conversational data for ASR training. Both SASC and C-SASC are evaluated extensively under a wide range of simulation configurations, using conversational statistics derived from CallHome, BEA-Dialogue, and GRASS corpora. Experimental results show that speaker-aware conversational simulation consistently improves recognition performance over naive concatenation-based augmentation. While the additional duration conditioning in C-SASC yields modest but systematic gains--most notably in character-level error rates--its effectiveness depends on the match between source conversational statistics and the target domain. Overall, our findings confirm the robustness of speaker-aware conversational simulation for Hungarian ASR and highlight the benefits and limitations of increasingly detailed temporal modeling in synthetic dialogue generation.

### Beyond Many-Shot Translation: Scaling In-Context Demonstrations For Low-Resource Machine Translation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04764v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04764v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04764v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04764v1)

Building machine translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages is notably difficult due to the scarcity of high-quality data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains.

### When Silence Is Golden: Can LLMs Learn to Abstain in Temporal QA and Beyond?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04755v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04755v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04755v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04755v1)

Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\%$ and $5.80\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.

### Exploiting contextual information to improve stance detection in informal political discourse with LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04750v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04750v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04750v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04750v1)

2026/02/04 16:49 GTM

This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for political stance detection in informal online discourse, where language is often sarcastic, ambiguous, and context-dependent. We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\% to +38.5\%, achieving up to 74\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches. We also analyze how profile size and post selection strategies affect performance, showing that strategically chosen political content yields better results than larger, randomly selected contexts. These findings underscore the value of incorporating user-level context to enhance LLM performance in nuanced political classification tasks.

### Inference-Time Reasoning Selectively Reduces Implicit Social Bias in Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04742v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04742v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04742v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04742v1)

Drawing on constructs from psychology, prior work has identified a distinction between explicit and implicit bias in large language models (LLMs). While many LLMs undergo post-training alignment and safety procedures to avoid expressions of explicit social bias, they still exhibit significant implicit biases on indirect tasks resembling the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Recent work has further shown that inference-time reasoning can impair LLM performance on tasks that rely on implicit statistical learning. Motivated by a theoretical link between implicit associations and statistical learning in human cognition, we examine how reasoning-enabled inference affects implicit bias in LLMs. We find that enabling reasoning significantly reduces measured implicit bias on an IAT-style evaluation for some model classes across fifteen stereotype topics. This effect appears specific to social bias domains, as we observe no corresponding reduction for non-social implicit associations. As reasoning is increasingly enabled by default in deployed LLMs, these findings suggest that it can meaningfully alter fairness evaluation outcomes in some systems, while also raising questions about how alignment procedures interact with inference-time reasoning to drive variation in bias reduction across model types. More broadly, this work highlights how theory from cognitive science and psychology can complement AI evaluation research by providing methodological and interpretive frameworks that reveal new insights into model behavior.

### Alignment Drift in Multimodal LLMs: A Two-Phase, Longitudinal Evaluation of Harm Across Eight Model Releases
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04739v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04739v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04739v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04739v1)

2026/02/04 16:42 GTM

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet their safety under adversarial prompting remains underexplored. We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.

### From Data to Behavior: Predicting Unintended Model Behaviors Before Training
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04735v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04735v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04735v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04735v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.

### Less Finetuning, Better Retrieval: Rethinking LLM Adaptation for Biomedical Retrievers via Synthetic Data and Model Merging
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04731v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04731v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04731v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04731v1)

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the backbone of grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), improving knowledge updates and reducing hallucinations. Recently, LLM-based retriever models have shown state-of-the-art performance for RAG applications. However, several technical aspects remain underexplored on how to adapt general-purpose LLMs into effective domain-specific retrievers, especially in specialized domains such as biomedicine. We present Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM), a modular framework that enhances decoder-only LLMs with synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging. Experiments on a subset of 12 medical and general tasks from the MTEB benchmark show STM boosts task-specific experts by up to 23.5\% (average 7.5\%) and produces merged models that outperform both single experts and strong baselines without extensive pretraining. Our results demonstrate a scalable, efficient path for turning general LLMs into high-performing, domain-specialized retrievers, preserving general-domain capabilities while excelling on specialized tasks.

### "Be My Cheese?": Cultural Nuance Benchmarking for Machine Translation in Multilingual LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04729v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04729v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04729v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04729v1)

We present a large-scale human evaluation benchmark for assessing cultural localisation in machine translation produced by state-of-the-art multilingual large language models (LLMs). Existing MT benchmarks emphasise token-level and grammatical accuracy, but of ten overlook pragmatic and culturally grounded competencies required for real-world localisation. Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.
  Across full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance. To our knowledge, this is the first multilingual, human-annotated benchmark focused explicitly on cultural nuance in translation and localisation, highlighting the need for culturally informed training data, improved cross-lingual pragmatics, and evaluation paradigms that better reflect real-world communicative competence.

### Identifying Intervenable and Interpretable Features via Orthogonality Regularization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04718v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04718v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04718v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04718v1)

With recent progress on fine-tuning language models around a fixed sparse autoencoder, we disentangle the decoder matrix into almost orthogonal features. This reduces interference and superposition between the features, while keeping performance on the target dataset essentially unchanged. Our orthogonality penalty leads to identifiable features, ensuring the uniqueness of the decomposition. Further, we find that the distance between embedded feature explanations increases with stricter orthogonality penalty, a desirable property for interpretability. Invoking the $\textit{Independent Causal Mechanisms}$ principle, we argue that orthogonality promotes modular representations amenable to causal intervention. We empirically show that these increasingly orthogonalized features allow for isolated interventions. Our code is available under $\texttt{https://github.com/mrtzmllr/sae-icm}$.

### Linguistically Informed Evaluation of Multilingual ASR for African Languages
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04716v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04716v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04716v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04716v1)

Word Error Rate (WER) mischaracterizes ASR models' performance for African languages by combining phonological, tone, and other linguistic errors into a single lexical error. By contrast, Feature Error Rate (FER) has recently attracted attention as a viable metric that reveals linguistically meaningful errors in models' performance. In this paper, we evaluate three speech encoders on two African languages by complementing WER with CER, and FER, and add a tone-aware extension (TER). We show that by computing errors on phonological features, FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns even when word-level accuracy remains low. Our results reveal that models perform better on segmental features, while tones (especially mid and downstep) remain the most challenging features. Results on Yoruba show a striking differential in metrics, with WER=0.788, CER=0.305, and FER=0.151. Similarly for Uneme (an endangered language absent from pretraining data) a model with near-total WER and 0.461 CER achieves the relatively low FER of 0.267. This indicates model error is often attributable to individual phonetic feature errors, which is obscured by all-or-nothing metrics like WER.

### LiteToken: Removing Intermediate Merge Residues From BPE Tokenizers
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04706v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04706v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04706v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04706v1)

2026/02/04 16:19 GTM

Tokenization is fundamental to how language models represent and process text, yet the behavior of widely used BPE tokenizers has received far less study than model architectures and training. In this paper, we investigate intermediate merge residues in BPE vocabularies: tokens that are frequent during merge learning so that retained in the final vocabulary, but are mostly further merged and rarely emitted when tokenizing the corpus during tokenizer usage. Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens. Because the affected tokens are rarely used, pretrained models can often accommodate the modified tokenizer without additional fine-tuning. Experiments show that LiteToken reduces token fragmentation, reduces parameters, and improves robustness to noisy or misspelled inputs, while preserving overall performance.

### ERNIE 5.0 Technical Report
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04705v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04705v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04705v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04705v1)

2026/02/04 16:18 GTM

In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.

### LinGO: A Linguistic Graph Optimization Framework with LLMs for Interpreting Intents of Online Uncivil Discourse
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04693v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04693v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04693v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04693v1)

Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.

### Investigating Disability Representations in Text-to-Image Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04687v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04687v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04687v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04687v1)

Text-to-image generative models have made remarkable progress in producing high-quality visual content from textual descriptions, yet concerns remain about how they represent social groups. While characteristics like gender and race have received increasing attention, disability representations remain underexplored. This study investigates how people with disabilities are represented in AI-generated images by analyzing outputs from Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 using a structured prompt design. We analyze disability representations by comparing image similarities between generic disability prompts and prompts referring to specific disability categories. Moreover, we evaluate how mitigation strategies influence disability portrayals, with a focus on assessing affective framing through sentiment polarity analysis, combining both automatic and human evaluation. Our findings reveal persistent representational imbalances and highlight the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of generative models to foster more diverse and inclusive portrayals of disability.

### Audio ControlNet for Fine-Grained Audio Generation and Editing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04680v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04680v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04680v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04680v1)

2026/02/04 15:52 GTM

We study the fine-grained text-to-audio (T2A) generation task. While recent models can synthesize high-quality audio from text descriptions, they often lack precise control over attributes such as loudness, pitch, and sound events. Unlike prior approaches that retrain models for specific control types, we propose to train ControlNet models on top of pre-trained T2A backbones to achieve controllable generation over loudness, pitch, and event roll. We introduce two designs, T2A-ControlNet and T2A-Adapter, and show that the T2A-Adapter model offers a more efficient structure with strong control ability. With only 38M additional parameters, T2A-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AudioSet-Strong in both event-level and segment-level F1 scores. We further extend this framework to audio editing, proposing T2A-Editor for removing and inserting audio events at time locations specified by instructions. Models, code, dataset pipelines, and benchmarks will be released to support future research on controllable audio generation and editing.

### Overstating Attitudes, Ignoring Networks: LLM Biases in Simulating Misinformation Susceptibility
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04674v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04674v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04674v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04674v1)

2026/02/04 15:48 GTM

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human judgment in computational social science, yet their ability to reproduce patterns of susceptibility to misinformation remains unclear. We test whether LLM-simulated survey respondents, prompted with participant profiles drawn from social survey data measuring network, demographic, attitudinal and behavioral features, can reproduce human patterns of misinformation belief and sharing. Using three online surveys as baselines, we evaluate whether LLM outputs match observed response distributions and recover feature-outcome associations present in the original survey data. LLM-generated responses capture broad distributional tendencies and show modest correlation with human responses, but consistently overstate the association between belief and sharing. Linear models fit to simulated responses exhibit substantially higher explained variance and place disproportionate weight on attitudinal and behavioral features, while largely ignoring personal network characteristics, relative to models fit to human responses. Analyses of model-generated reasoning and LLM training data suggest that these distortions reflect systematic biases in how misinformation-related concepts are represented. Our findings suggest that LLM-based survey simulations are better suited for diagnosing systematic divergences from human judgment than for substituting it.

### Delving into Muon and Beyond: Deep Analysis and Extensions

The Muon optimizer has recently attracted considerable attention for its strong empirical performance and use of orthogonalized updates on matrix-shaped parameters, yet its underlying mechanisms and relationship to adaptive optimizers such as Adam remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \boldsymbolΣ^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/Ocram7/BeyondMuon.

### Approaches to Semantic Textual Similarity in Slovak Language: From Algorithms to Transformers
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04659v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04659v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04659v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04659v1)

Semantic textual similarity (STS) plays a crucial role in many natural language processing tasks. While extensively studied in high-resource languages, STS remains challenging for under-resourced languages such as Slovak. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of sentence-level STS methods applied to Slovak, including traditional algorithms, supervised machine learning models, and third-party deep learning tools. We trained several machine learning models using outputs from traditional algorithms as features, with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning jointly guided by artificial bee colony optimization. Finally, we evaluated several third-party tools, including fine-tuned model by CloudNLP, OpenAI's embedding models, GPT-4 model, and pretrained SlovakBERT model. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between different approaches.

### Outcome Accuracy is Not Enough: Aligning the Reasoning Process of Reward Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04649v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04649v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04649v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04649v1)

2026/02/04 15:24 GTM

Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) and LLM-as-a-Judge exhibit deceptive alignment by producing correct judgments for incorrect reasons, as they are trained and evaluated to prioritize Outcome Accuracy, which undermines their ability to generalize during RLHF. We introduce Rationale Consistency, a fine-grained metric that quantifies the alignment between the model's reasoning process and human judgment. Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%. Using RM during RLHF, our method effectively improves performance as demonstrated on Arena Hard v2, notably yielding a 7% improvement in creative writing tasks. Further analysis confirms that our method escapes the deceptive alignment trap, effectively reversing the decline in rationale consistency observed in outcome-only training.

### Mapping the Web of Science, a large-scale graph and text-based dataset with LLM embeddings

Large text data sets, such as publications, websites, and other text-based media, inherit two distinct types of features: (1) the text itself, its information conveyed through semantics, and (2) its relationship to other texts through links, references, or shared attributes. While the latter can be described as a graph structure and can be handled by a range of established algorithms for classification and prediction, the former has recently gained new potential through the use of LLM embedding models. Demonstrating these possibilities and their practicability, we investigate the Web of Science dataset, containing ~56 million scientific publications through the lens of our proposed embedding method, revealing a self-structured landscape of texts.

### LEAD: Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding for Faithful Radiology Report Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04617v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04617v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04617v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04617v1)

Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to produce accurate and coherent diagnostics from medical images. Although large vision language models (LVLM) improve report fluency and accuracy, they exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet image-ungrounded pathological details. Existing methods primarily rely on external knowledge guidance to facilitate the alignment between generated text and visual information. However, these approaches often ignore the inherent decoding priors and vision-language alignment biases in pretrained models and lack robustness due to reliance on constructed guidance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), a novel method to inherently modify the LVLM decoding trajectory. A multiple experts module is designed for extracting distinct pathological features which are integrated into each decoder layer via a gating mechanism. This layer-wise architecture enables the LLM to consult expert features at every inference step via a learned gating function, thereby dynamically rectifying decoding biases and steering the generation toward factual consistency. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the LEAD method yields effective improvements in clinical accuracy metrics and mitigates hallucinations while preserving high generation quality.

### Disentangling meaning from language in LLM-based machine translation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04613v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04613v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04613v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04613v1)

Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) seeks to explain how neural networks implement their capabilities, but the scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has limited prior MI work in Machine Translation (MT) to word-level analyses. We study sentence-level MT from a mechanistic perspective by analyzing attention heads to understand how LLMs internally encode and distribute translation functions. We decompose MT into two subtasks: producing text in the target language (i.e. target language identification) and preserving the input sentence's meaning (i.e. sentence equivalence). Across three families of open-source models and 20 translation directions, we find that distinct, sparse sets of attention heads specialize in each subtask. Based on this insight, we construct subtask-specific steering vectors and show that modifying just 1% of the relevant heads enables instruction-free MT performance comparable to instruction-based prompting, while ablating these heads selectively disrupts their corresponding translation functions.

### Focus-LIME: Surgical Interpretation of Long-Context Large Language Models via Proxy-Based Neighborhood Selection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04607v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04607v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04607v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04607v1)

As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to handle massive context windows, achieving surgical feature-level interpretation is essential for high-stakes tasks like legal auditing and code debugging. However, existing local model-agnostic explanation methods face a critical dilemma in these scenarios: feature-based methods suffer from attribution dilution due to high feature dimensionality, thus failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose Focus-LIME, a coarse-to-fine framework designed to restore the tractability of surgical interpretation. Focus-LIME utilizes a proxy model to curate the perturbation neighborhood, allowing the target model to perform fine-grained attribution exclusively within the optimized context. Empirical evaluations on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our method makes surgical explanations practicable and provides faithful explanations to users.

### RexBERT: Context Specialized Bidirectional Encoders for E-commerce

Encoder-only transformers remain indispensable in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems where latency, stability, and cost are paramount. Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.

### Beyond Holistic Scores: Automatic Trait-Based Quality Scoring of Argumentative Essays
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04604v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04604v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04604v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04604v1)

Automated Essay Scoring systems have traditionally focused on holistic scores, limiting their pedagogical usefulness, especially in the case of complex essay genres such as argumentative writing. In educational contexts, teachers and learners require interpretable, trait-level feedback that aligns with instructional goals and established rubrics. In this paper, we study trait-based Automatic Argumentative Essay Scoring using two complementary modeling paradigms designed for realistic educational deployment: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs, and (2) a supervised, encoder-based BigBird model with a CORAL-style ordinal regression formulation, optimized for long-sequence understanding. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the ASAP++ dataset, which includes essay scores across five quality traits, offering strong coverage of core argumentation dimensions. LLMs are prompted with designed, rubric-aligned in-context examples, along with feedback and confidence requests, while we explicitly model ordinality in scores with the BigBird model via the rank-consistent CORAL framework. Our results show that explicitly modeling score ordinality substantially improves agreement with human raters across all traits, outperforming LLMs and nominal classification and regression-based baselines. This finding reinforces the importance of aligning model objectives with rubric semantics for educational assessment. At the same time, small open-source LLMs achieve a competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning, particularly for reasoning-oriented traits, while enabling transparent, privacy-preserving, and locally deployable assessment scenarios. Our findings provide methodological, modeling, and practical insights for the design of AI-based educational systems that aim to deliver interpretable, rubric-aligned feedback for argumentative writing.

### VILLAIN at AVerImaTeC: Verifying Image-Text Claims via Multi-Agent Collaboration

2026/02/04 14:12 GTM

This paper describes VILLAIN, a multimodal fact-checking system that verifies image-text claims through prompt-based multi-agent collaboration. For the AVerImaTeC shared task, VILLAIN employs vision-language model agents across multiple stages of fact-checking. Textual and visual evidence is retrieved from the knowledge store enriched through additional web collection. To identify key information and address inconsistencies among evidence items, modality-specific and cross-modal agents generate analysis reports. In the subsequent stage, question-answer pairs are produced based on these reports. Finally, the Verdict Prediction agent produces the verification outcome based on the image-text claim and the generated question-answer pairs. Our system ranked first on the leaderboard across all evaluation metrics. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ssu-humane/VILLAIN.

### Trust The Typical

Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.

### AIANO: Enhancing Information Retrieval with AI-Augmented Annotation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04579v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04579v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04579v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04579v1)

2026/02/04 14:05 GTM

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has rapidly increased the need for high-quality, curated information retrieval datasets. These datasets, however, are currently created with off-the-shelf annotation tools that make the annotation process complex and inefficient. To streamline this process, we developed a specialized annotation tool - AIANO. By adopting an AI-augmented annotation workflow that tightly integrates human expertise with LLM assistance, AIANO enables annotators to leverage AI suggestions while retaining full control over annotation decisions. In a within-subject user study ($n = 15$), participants created question-answering datasets using both a baseline tool and AIANO. AIANO nearly doubled annotation speed compared to the baseline while being easier to use and improving retrieval accuracy. These results demonstrate that AIANO's AI-augmented approach accelerates and enhances dataset creation for information retrieval tasks, advancing annotation capabilities in retrieval-intensive domains.

Large language models present challenges for principled uncertainty quantification, in part due to their complexity and the diversity of their outputs. Semantic dispersion, or the variance in the meaning of sampled answers, has been proposed as a useful proxy for model uncertainty, but the associated computational cost prohibits its use in latency-critical applications. We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection. We term this technique Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD), which we suggest provides a general framework for distilling predictive uncertainty in complex output spaces beyond language.

### Can LLMs capture stable human-generated sentence entropy measures?

Predicting upcoming words is a core mechanism of language comprehension and may be quantified using Shannon entropy. There is currently no empirical consensus on how many human responses are required to obtain stable and unbiased entropy estimates at the word level. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as substitutes for human norming data, yet their ability to reproduce stable human entropy remains unclear. Here, we address both issues using two large publicly available cloze datasets in German 1 and English 2. We implemented a bootstrap-based convergence analysis that tracks how entropy estimates stabilize as a function of sample size. Across both languages, more than 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates within the available sample sizes. 90% of sentences converged after 111 responses in German and 81 responses in English, while low-entropy sentences (<1) required as few as 20 responses and high-entropy sentences (>2.5) substantially more. These findings provide the first direct empirical validation for common norming practices and demonstrate that convergence critically depends on sentence predictability. We then compared stable human entropy values with entropy estimates derived from several LLMs, including GPT-4o, using both logit-based probability extraction and sampling-based frequency estimation, GPT2-xl/german-GPT-2, RoBERTa Base/GottBERT, and LLaMA 2 7B Chat. GPT-4o showed the highest correspondence with human data, although alignment depended strongly on the extraction method and prompt design. Logit-based estimates minimized absolute error, whereas sampling-based estimates were better in capturing the dispersion of human variability. Together, our results establish practical guidelines for human norming and show that while LLMs can approximate human entropy, they are not interchangeable with stable human-derived distributions.

### Textual Planning with Explicit Latent Transitions
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04557v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04557v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04557v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04557v1)

Planning with LLMs is bottlenecked by token-by-token generation and repeated full forward passes, making multi-step lookahead and rollout-based search expensive in latency and compute. We propose EmbedPlan, which replaces autoregressive next-state generation with a lightweight transition model operating in a frozen language embedding space. EmbedPlan encodes natural language state and action descriptions into vectors, predicts the next-state embedding, and retrieves the next state by nearest-neighbor similarity, enabling fast planning computation without fine-tuning the encoder. We evaluate next-state prediction across nine classical planning domains using six evaluation protocols of increasing difficulty: interpolation, plan-variant, extrapolation, multi-domain, cross-domain, and leave-one-out. Results show near-perfect interpolation performance but a sharp degradation when generalization requires transfer to unseen problems or unseen domains; plan-variant evaluation indicates generalization to alternative plans rather than memorizing seen trajectories. Overall, frozen embeddings support within-domain dynamics learning after observing a domain's transitions, while transfer across domain boundaries remains a bottleneck.

### Rethinking Weight Tying: Pseudo-Inverse Tying for Stable LM Training and Updates
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04556v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04556v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04556v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04556v1)

Weight tying is widely used in compact language models to reduce parameters by sharing the token table between the input embedding and the output projection. However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters. We evaluate PIT on on-device models spanning 256M-1.3B parameters across pretraining and adaptation, and consistently observe improved training stability, stronger layerwise semantic consistency, and substantially reduced side effects.

### Unmasking Superspreaders: Data-Driven Approaches for Identifying and Comparing Key Influencers of Conspiracy Theories on X.com

Conspiracy theories can threaten society by spreading misinformation, deepening polarization, and eroding trust in democratic institutions. Social media often fuels the spread of conspiracies, primarily driven by two key actors: Superspreaders -- influential individuals disseminating conspiracy content at disproportionately high rates, and Bots -- automated accounts designed to amplify conspiracies strategically. To counter the spread of conspiracy theories, it is critical to both identify these actors and to better understand their behavior. However, a systematic analysis of these actors as well as real-world-applicable identification methods are still lacking. In this study, we leverage over seven million tweets from the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze key differences between Human Superspreaders and Bots across dimensions such as linguistic complexity, toxicity, and hashtag usage. Our analysis reveals distinct communication strategies: Superspreaders tend to use more complex language and substantive content while relying less on structural elements like hashtags and emojis, likely to enhance credibility and authority. By contrast, Bots favor simpler language and strategic cross-usage of hashtags, likely to increase accessibility, facilitate infiltration into trending discussions, and amplify reach. To counter both Human Superspreaders and Bots, we propose and evaluate 27 novel metrics for quantifying the severity of conspiracy theory spread. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of an adapted H-Index for computationally feasible identification of Human Superspreaders. By identifying behavioral patterns unique to Human Superspreaders and Bots as well as providing suitable identification methods, this study provides a foundation for mitigation strategies, including platform moderation policies, temporary and permanent account suspensions, and public awareness campaigns.

### LycheeDecode: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Hybrid-Head Sparse Decoding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04541v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04541v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04541v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04541v1)

2026/02/04 13:34 GTM

The proliferation of long-context large language models (LLMs) exposes a key bottleneck: the rapidly expanding key-value cache during decoding, which imposes heavy memory and latency costs. While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.

### PersoPilot: An Adaptive AI-Copilot for Transparent Contextualized Persona Classification and Personalized Response Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04540v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04540v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04540v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04540v1)

Understanding and classifying user personas is critical for delivering effective personalization. While persona information offers valuable insights, its full potential is realized only when contextualized, linking user characteristics with situational context to enable more precise and meaningful service provision. Existing systems often treat persona and context as separate inputs, limiting their ability to generate nuanced, adaptive interactions. To address this gap, we present PersoPilot, an agentic AI-Copilot that integrates persona understanding with contextual analysis to support both end users and analysts. End users interact through a transparent, explainable chat interface, where they can express preferences in natural language, request recommendations, and receive information tailored to their immediate task. On the analyst side, PersoPilot delivers a transparent, reasoning-powered labeling assistant, integrated with an active learning-driven classification process that adapts over time with new labeled data. This feedback loop enables targeted service recommendations and adaptive personalization, bridging the gap between raw persona data and actionable, context-aware insights. As an adaptable framework, PersoPilot is applicable to a broad range of service personalization scenarios.

### $C$-$ΔΘ$: Circuit-Restricted Weight Arithmetic for Selective Refusal

Modern deployments require LLMs to enforce safety policies at scale, yet many controls rely on inference-time interventions that add recurring compute cost and serving complexity. Activation steering is widely used, but it requires runtime hooks and scales cost with the number of generations; conditional variants improve selectivity by gating when steering is applied but still retain an inference-time control path. We ask whether selective refusal can be moved entirely offline: can a mechanistic understanding of category-specific refusal be distilled into a circuit-restricted weight update that deploys as a standard checkpoint? We propose C-Δθ: Circuit Restricted Weight Arithmetic, which (i) localizes refusal-causal computation as a sparse circuit using EAP-IG and (ii) computes a constrained weight update ΔθC supported only on that circuit (typically <5% of parameters). Applying ΔθC yields a drop-in edited checkpoint with no inference-time hooks, shifting cost from per-request intervention to a one-time offline update. We evaluate category-targeted selectivity and capability retention on refusal and utility benchmarks.

### ReFRAME or Remain: Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection with Frame Semantics
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04514v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04514v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04514v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04514v1)

2026/02/04 13:00 GTM

The majority of contemporary computational methods for lexical semantic change (LSC) detection are based on neural embedding distributional representations. Although these models perform well on LSC benchmarks, their results are often difficult to interpret. We explore an alternative approach that relies solely on frame semantics. We show that this method is effective for detecting semantic change and can even outperform many distributional semantic models. Finally, we present a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of its predictions, demonstrating that they are both plausible and highly interpretable

### Model-Dowser: Data-Free Importance Probing to Mitigate Catastrophic Forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04509v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04509v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04509v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04509v1)

2026/02/04 12:56 GTM

Fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on task-specific data is an effective way to improve performance on downstream applications. However, such adaptation often leads to a degradation in generalization on pretrained tasks, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting. Existing methods that aim to mitigate this issue either become ineffective when fine-tuning deeper layers of the language decoder or scale poorly with increasing model size. To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.

### PersoDPO: Scalable Preference Optimization for Instruction-Adherent, Persona-Grounded Dialogue via Multi-LLM Evaluation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04493v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04493v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04493v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04493v1)

Personalization and contextual coherence are two essential components in building effective persona-grounded dialogue systems. These aspects play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement and ensuring responses are more relevant and consistent with user identity. However, recent studies indicate that open-source large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle to generate responses that are both contextually grounded and aligned with persona cues, despite exhibiting strong general conversational abilities like fluency and naturalness. We present PersoDPO, a scalable preference optimisation framework that uses supervision signals from automatic evaluations of responses generated by both closed-source and open-source LLMs to fine-tune dialogue models. The framework integrates evaluation metrics targeting coherence and personalization, along with a length-format compliance feature to promote instruction adherence. These signals are combined to automatically construct high-quality preference pairs without manual annotation, enabling a scalable and reproducible training pipeline. Experiments on the FoCus dataset show that an open-source language model fine-tuned with the PersoDPO framework consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines and a standard Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) variant across multiple evaluation dimensions.

### Deconstructing sentence disambiguation by joint latent modeling of reading paradigms: LLM surprisal is not enough

Using temporarily ambiguous garden-path sentences ("While the team trained the striker wondered ...") as a test case, we present a latent-process mixture model of human reading behavior across four different reading paradigms (eye tracking, uni- and bidirectional self-paced reading, Maze). The model distinguishes between garden-path probability, garden-path cost, and reanalysis cost, and yields more realistic processing cost estimates by taking into account trials with inattentive reading. We show that the model is able to reproduce empirical patterns with regard to rereading behavior, comprehension question responses, and grammaticality judgments. Cross-validation reveals that the mixture model also has better predictive fit to human reading patterns and end-of-trial task data than a mixture-free model based on GPT-2-derived surprisal values. We discuss implications for future work.

### Beyond Unimodal Shortcuts: MLLMs as Cross-Modal Reasoners for Grounded Named Entity Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04486v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04486v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04486v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04486v1)

2026/02/04 12:12 GTM

Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) aims to extract text-based entities, assign them semantic categories, and ground them to corresponding visual regions. In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines.

### Is Micro Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training Effective for Real-World Operations? Multi-Step Evaluation Reveals Potential and Bottlenecks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04466v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04466v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04466v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04466v1)

When applying LLMs to real-world enterprise operations, LLMs need to handle proprietary knowledge in small domains of specific operations ($\textbf{micro domains}$). A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.

### Growth First, Care Second? Tracing the Landscape of LLM Value Preferences in Everyday Dilemmas

People increasingly seek advice online from both human peers and large language model (LLM)-based chatbots. Such advice rarely involves identifying a single correct answer; instead, it typically requires navigating trade-offs among competing values. We aim to characterize how LLMs navigate value trade-offs across different advice-seeking contexts. First, we examine the value trade-off structure underlying advice seeking using a curated dataset from four advice-oriented subreddits. Using a bottom-up approach, we inductively construct a hierarchical value framework by aggregating fine-grained values extracted from individual advice options into higher-level value categories. We construct value co-occurrence networks to characterize how values co-occur within dilemmas and find substantial heterogeneity in value trade-off structures across advice-seeking contexts: a women-focused subreddit exhibits the highest network density, indicating more complex value conflicts; women's, men's, and friendship-related subreddits exhibit highly correlated value-conflict patterns centered on security-related tensions (security vs. respect/connection/commitment); by contrast, career advice forms a distinct structure where security frequently clashes with self-actualization and growth. We then evaluate LLM value preferences against these dilemmas and find that, across models and contexts, LLMs consistently prioritize values related to Exploration & Growth over Benevolence & Connection. This systemically skewed value orientation highlights a potential risk of value homogenization in AI-mediated advice, raising concerns about how such systems may shape decision-making and normative outcomes at scale.

### No One-Size-Fits-All: Building Systems For Translation to Bashkir, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tatar and Chuvash Using Synthetic And Original Data

We explore machine translation for five Turkic language pairs: Russian-Bashkir, Russian-Kazakh, Russian-Kyrgyz, English-Tatar, English-Chuvash. Fine-tuning nllb-200-distilled-600M with LoRA on synthetic data achieved chrF++ 49.71 for Kazakh and 46.94 for Bashkir. Prompting DeepSeek-V3.2 with retrieved similar examples achieved chrF++ 39.47 for Chuvash. For Tatar, zero-shot or retrieval-based approaches achieved chrF++ 41.6, while for Kyrgyz the zero-shot approach reached 45.6. We release the dataset and the obtained weights.

### Fine-Grained Activation Steering: Steering Less, Achieving More
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04428v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04428v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04428v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04428v1)

2026/02/04 11:03 GTM

Activation steering has emerged as a cost-effective paradigm for modifying large language model (LLM) behaviors. Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more.

### History-Guided Iterative Visual Reasoning with Self-Correction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04413v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04413v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04413v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04413v1)

Self-consistency methods are the core technique for improving the reasoning reliability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. For instance, using \texttt{Llama3.2-vision:11b} on the ScienceQA dataset, the model requires an average of 2.57 responses per question to achieve an accuracy of 78.90\%, representing a 107\% improvement over the baseline.

### Swordsman: Entropy-Driven Adaptive Block Partition for Efficient Diffusion Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04399v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04399v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04399v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04399v1)

Block-wise decoding effectively improves the inference speed and quality in diffusion language models (DLMs) by combining inter-block sequential denoising and intra-block parallel unmasking. However, existing block-wise decoding methods typically partition blocks in a rigid and fixed manner, which inevitably fragments complete semantic or syntactic constituents, leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by the entropy reduction hypothesis (ERH), we recognize that constituent boundaries offer greater opportunities for uncertainty reduction, which motivates us to employ entropy analysis for identifying constituent boundaries. Therefore, we propose Swordsman, an entropy-driven adaptive block-wise decoding framework for DLMs. Swordsman adaptively partitions blocks by identifying entropy shifts between adjacent tokens to better align with semantic or syntactic constituent boundaries. In addition, Swordsman dynamically adjusts unmasking thresholds conditioned on the real-time unmasking status within a block, further improving both efficiency and stability. As a training-free framework, supported by KV Cache, Swordsman demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across extensive evaluations.

### Bi-directional Bias Attribution: Debiasing Large Language Models without Modifying Prompts

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their outputs often exhibit social biases, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods, such as fine-tuning on additional datasets or prompt engineering, face scalability issues or compromise user experience in multi-turn interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer. Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance. Code is available at the github link: https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/Bi-directional-Bias-Attribution.

### Evaluating the Presence of Sex Bias in Clinical Reasoning by Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04392v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04392v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04392v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04392v1)

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in healthcare workflows for documentation, education, and clinical decision support. However, these systems are trained on large text corpora that encode existing biases, including sex disparities in diagnosis and treatment, raising concerns that such patterns may be reproduced or amplified. We systematically examined whether contemporary LLMs exhibit sex-specific biases in clinical reasoning and how model configuration influences these behaviours. We conducted three experiments using 50 clinician-authored vignettes spanning 44 specialties in which sex was non-informative to the initial diagnostic pathway. Four general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeekchat). All models demonstrated significant sex-assignment skew, with predicted sex differing by model. At temperature 0.5, ChatGPT assigned female sex in 70% of cases (95% CI 0.66-0.75), DeepSeek in 61% (0.57-0.65) and Claude in 59% (0.55-0.63), whereas Gemini showed a male skew, assigning a female sex in 36% of cases (0.32-0.41). Contemporary LLMs exhibit stable, model-specific sex biases in clinical reasoning. Permitting abstention reduces explicit labelling but does not eliminate downstream diagnostic differences. Safe clinical integration requires conservative and documented configuration, specialty-level clinical data auditing, and continued human oversight when deploying general-purpose models in healthcare settings.

### Beyond Rejection Sampling: Trajectory Fusion for Scaling Mathematical Reasoning

Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in mathematical reasoning, often fine-tuned using rejection sampling that retains only correct reasoning trajectories. While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective. Extensive experiments across multiple math benchmarks demonstrate that TrajFusion consistently outperforms RFT, particularly on challenging and long-form reasoning problems.

### Can Vision Replace Text in Working Memory? Evidence from Spatial n-Back in Vision-Language Models

Working memory is a central component of intelligent behavior, providing a dynamic workspace for maintaining and updating task-relevant information. Recent work has used n-back tasks to probe working-memory-like behavior in large language models, but it is unclear whether the same probe elicits comparable computations when information is carried in a visual rather than textual code in vision-language models. We evaluate Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison. We further show that grid size alters recent-repeat structure in the stimulus stream, thereby changing interference and error patterns. These results motivate computation-sensitive interpretations of multimodal working memory.

### From Assumptions to Actions: Turning LLM Reasoning into Uncertainty-Aware Planning for Embodied Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04326v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04326v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04326v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04326v1)

Embodied agents operating in multi-agent, partially observable, and decentralized environments must plan and act despite pervasive uncertainty about hidden objects and collaborators' intentions. Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning.

### A Domain-Specific Curated Benchmark for Entity and Document-Level Relation Extraction

Information Extraction (IE), encompassing Named Entity Recognition (NER), Named Entity Linking (NEL), and Relation Extraction (RE), is critical for transforming the rapidly growing volume of scientific publications into structured, actionable knowledge. This need is especially evident in fast-evolving biomedical fields such as the gut-brain axis, where research investigates complex interactions between the gut microbiota and brain-related disorders. Existing biomedical IE benchmarks, however, are often narrow in scope and rely heavily on distantly supervised or automatically generated annotations, limiting their utility for advancing robust IE methods. We introduce GutBrainIE, a benchmark based on more than 1,600 PubMed abstracts, manually annotated by biomedical and terminological experts with fine-grained entities, concept-level links, and relations. While grounded in the gut-brain axis, the benchmark's rich schema, multiple tasks, and combination of highly curated and weakly supervised data make it broadly applicable to the development and evaluation of biomedical IE systems across domains.

### Universal Robust Speech Adaptation for Cross-Domain Speech Recognition and Enhancement

Pre-trained models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech enhancement (SE) have exhibited remarkable capabilities under matched noise and channel conditions. However, these models often suffer from severe performance degradation when confronted with domain shifts, particularly in the presence of unseen noise and channel distortions. In view of this, we in this paper present URSA-GAN, a unified and domain-aware generative framework specifically designed to mitigate mismatches in both noise and channel conditions. URSA-GAN leverages a dual-embedding architecture that consists of a noise encoder and a channel encoder, each pre-trained with limited in-domain data to capture domain-relevant representations. These embeddings condition a GAN-based speech generator, facilitating the synthesis of speech that is acoustically aligned with the target domain while preserving phonetic content. To enhance generalization further, we propose dynamic stochastic perturbation, a novel regularization technique that introduces controlled variability into the embeddings during generation, promoting robustness to unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that URSA-GAN effectively reduces character error rates in ASR and improves perceptual metrics in SE across diverse noisy and mismatched channel scenarios. Notably, evaluations on compound test conditions with both channel and noise degradations confirm the generalization ability of URSA-GAN, yielding relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics.

### DeFrame: Debiasing Large Language Models Against Framing Effects

As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their fair responses across demographics has become crucial. Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., "A is better than B" vs. "B is worse than A") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of "framing disparity" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.

### Beyond Static Cropping: Layer-Adaptive Visual Localization and Decoding Enhancement

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.

### Revisiting Prompt Sensitivity in Large Language Models for Text Classification: The Role of Prompt Underspecification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04297v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04297v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04297v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04297v1)

Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as zero-shot and few-shot classifiers, where task behaviour is largely controlled through prompting. A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.

### How Few-shot Demonstrations Affect Prompt-based Defenses Against LLM Jailbreak Attacks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04294v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04294v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04294v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04294v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) face increasing threats from jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment. While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in real-world LLM applications.

### Guided Verifier: Collaborative Multimodal Reasoning via Dynamic Process Supervision
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04290v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04290v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04290v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04290v1)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, prevailing paradigms typically rely on solitary rollout strategies where the model works alone. This lack of intermediate oversight renders the reasoning process susceptible to error propagation, where early logical deviations cascade into irreversible failures, resulting in noisy optimization signals. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{Guided Verifier} framework to address these structural limitations. Moving beyond passive terminal rewards, we introduce a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks alongside the policy. During the rollout phase, this verifier interacts with the policy model in real-time, detecting inconsistencies and providing directional signals to steer the model toward valid trajectories. To facilitate this, we develop a specialized data synthesis pipeline targeting multimodal hallucinations, constructing \textbf{CoRe} dataset of process-level negatives and \textbf{Co}rrect-guide \textbf{Re}asoning trajectories to train the guided verifier. Extensive experiments on MathVista, MathVerse and MMMU indicate that by allocating compute to collaborative inference and dynamic verification, an 8B-parameter model can achieve strong performance.

### Proxy Compression for Language Modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04289v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04289v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04289v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04289v1)

Modern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by a fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.

### Contextual Drag: How Errors in the Context Affect LLM Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04288v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04288v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04288v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04288v1)

2026/02/04 07:36 GTM

Central to many self-improvement pipelines for large language models (LLMs) is the assumption that models can improve by reflecting on past mistakes. We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures.

### ECG-R1: Protocol-Guided and Modality-Agnostic MLLM for Reliable ECG Interpretation

Electrocardiography (ECG) serves as an indispensable diagnostic tool in clinical practice, yet existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain unreliable for ECG interpretation, often producing plausible but clinically incorrect analyses. To address this, we propose ECG-R1, the first reasoning MLLM designed for reliable ECG interpretation via three innovations. First, we construct the interpretation corpus using \textit{Protocol-Guided Instruction Data Generation}, grounding interpretation in measurable ECG features and monograph-defined quantitative thresholds and diagnostic logic. Second, we present a modality-decoupled architecture with \textit{Interleaved Modality Dropout} to improve robustness and cross-modal consistency when either the ECG signal or ECG image is missing. Third, we present \textit{Reinforcement Learning with ECG Diagnostic Evidence Rewards} to strengthen evidence-grounded ECG interpretation. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the ECG interpretation capabilities of proprietary, open-source, and medical MLLMs, and provide the first quantitative evidence that severe hallucinations are widespread, suggesting that the public should not directly trust these outputs without independent verification. Code and data are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/ECG-R1}{here}, and an online platform can be accessed at \href{http://ai.heartvoice.com.cn/ECG-R1/}{here}.

### Scaling Agentic Verifier for Competitive Coding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04254v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04254v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04254v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04254v1)

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong coding capabilities but still struggle to solve competitive programming problems correctly in a single attempt. Execution-based re-ranking offers a promising test-time scaling strategy, yet existing methods are constrained by either difficult test case generation or inefficient random input sampling. To address this limitation, we propose Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that actively reasons about program behaviors and searches for highly discriminative test inputs that expose behavioral discrepancies among candidate solutions. Through multi-turn interaction with code execution environments, the verifier iteratively refines the candidate input generator and produces targeted counterexamples rather than blindly sampling inputs. We train the verifier to acquire this discriminative input generation capability via a scalable pipeline combining large-scale data synthesis, rejection fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across five competitive programming benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong execution-based baselines, achieving up to +10-15% absolute gains in Best@K accuracy. Further analysis reveals clear test-time scaling behavior and highlights the verifier's broader potential beyond reranking.

### Empirical-MCTS: Continuous Agent Evolution via Dual-Experience Monte Carlo Tree Search
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04248v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04248v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04248v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04248v1)

2026/02/04 06:14 GTM

Inference-time scaling strategies, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents. These results underscore the critical necessity of coupling structured search with empirical accumulation for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks.

### DementiaBank-Emotion: A Multi-Rater Emotion Annotation Corpus for Alzheimer's Disease Speech (Version 1.0)
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04247v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04247v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04247v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04247v1)

2026/02/04 06:13 GTM

We present DementiaBank-Emotion, the first multi-rater emotion annotation corpus for Alzheimer's disease (AD) speech. Annotating 1,492 utterances from 108 speakers for Ekman's six basic emotions and neutral, we find that AD patients express significantly more non-neutral emotions (16.9%) than healthy controls (5.7%; p < .001). Exploratory acoustic analysis suggests a possible dissociation: control speakers showed substantial F0 modulation for sadness (Delta = -3.45 semitones from baseline), whereas AD speakers showed minimal change (Delta = +0.11 semitones; interaction p = .023), though this finding is based on limited samples (sadness: n=5 control, n=15 AD) and requires replication. Within AD speech, loudness differentiates emotion categories, indicating partially preserved emotion-prosody mappings. We release the corpus, annotation guidelines, and calibration workshop materials to support research on emotion recognition in clinical populations.

### CoLT: Reasoning with Chain of Latent Tool Calls
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04246v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04246v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04246v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04246v1)

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a critical technique in enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and latent reasoning methods have been proposed to accelerate the inefficient token-level reasoning chain. We notice that existing latent reasoning methods generally require model structure augmentation and exhaustive training, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step. In this way, we can ensure that the main model reasons in the explicit token space, preserving its ability while improving efficiency. Experimental results on four mathematical datasets demonstrate that CoLT achieves higher accuracy and shorter reasoning length than baseline latent models, and is compatible with reinforcement learning algorithms and different decoder structures.

### Tokenization and Morphological Fidelity in Uralic NLP: A Cross-Lingual Evaluation

Subword tokenization critically affects Natural Language Processing (NLP) performance, yet its behavior in morphologically rich and low-resource language families remains under-explored. This study systematically compares three subword paradigms -- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), Overlap BPE (OBPE), and Unigram Language Model -- across six Uralic languages with varying resource availability and typological diversity. Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a controlled downstream task, we show that OBPE consistently achieves stronger morphological alignment and higher tagging accuracy than conventional methods, particularly within the Latin-script group. These gains arise from reduced fragmentation in open-class categories and a better balance across the frequency spectrum. Transfer efficacy further depends on the downstream tagging architecture, interacting with both training volume and genealogical proximity. Taken together, these findings highlight that morphology-sensitive tokenization is not merely a preprocessing choice but a decisive factor in enabling effective cross-lingual transfer for agglutinative, low-resource languages.

### Capturing Visual Environment Structure Correlates with Control Performance

The choice of visual representation is key to scaling generalist robot policies. However, direct evaluation via policy rollouts is expensive, even in simulation. Existing proxy metrics focus on the representation's capacity to capture narrow aspects of the visual world, like object shape, limiting generalization across environments. In this paper, we take an analytical perspective: we probe pretrained visual encoders by measuring how well they support decoding of environment state -- including geometry, object structure, and physical attributes -- from images. Leveraging simulation environments with access to ground-truth state, we show that this probing accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance across diverse environments and learning settings, significantly outperforming prior metrics and enabling efficient representation selection. More broadly, our study provides insight into the representational properties that support generalizable manipulation, suggesting that learning to encode the latent physical state of the environment is a promising objective for control.

### PDF-HR: Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots

Pose and motion priors play a crucial role in humanoid robotics. Although such priors have been widely studied in human motion recovery (HMR) domain with a range of models, their adoption for humanoid robots remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data. In this work, we introduce Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots (PDF-HR), a lightweight prior that represents the robot pose distribution as a continuous and differentiable manifold. Given an arbitrary pose, PDF-HR predicts its distance to a large corpus of retargeted robot poses, yielding a smooth measure of pose plausibility that is well suited for optimization and control. PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines. Code and models will be released.

### Beyond the Control Equations: An Artifact Study of Implementation Quality in Robot Control Software

A controller -- a software module managing hardware behavior -- is a key component of a typical robot system. While control theory gives safety guarantees for standard controller designs, the practical implementation of controllers in software introduces complexities that are often overlooked. Controllers are often designed in continuous space, while the software is executed in discrete space, undermining some of the theoretical guarantees. Despite extensive research on control theory and control modeling, little attention has been paid to the implementations of controllers and how their theoretical guarantees are ensured in real-world software systems. We investigate 184 real-world controller implementations in open-source robot software. We examine their application context, the implementation characteristics, and the testing methods employed to ensure correctness. We find that the implementations often handle discretization in an ad hoc manner, leading to potential issues with real-time reliability. Challenges such as timing inconsistencies, lack of proper error handling, and inadequate consideration of real-time constraints further complicate matters. Testing practices are superficial, no systematic verification of theoretical guarantees is used, leaving possible inconsistencies between expected and actual behavior. Our findings highlight the need for improved implementation guidelines and rigorous verification techniques to ensure the reliability and safety of robotic controllers in practice.

We introduce PuppetAI, a modular soft robot interaction platform. This platform offers a scalable cable-driven actuation system and a customizable, puppet-inspired robot gesture framework, supporting a multitude of interaction gesture robot design formats. The platform comprises a four-layer decoupled software architecture that includes perceptual processing, affective modeling, motion scheduling, and low-level actuation. We also implemented an affective expression loop that connects human input to the robot platform by producing real-time emotional gestural responses to human vocal input. For our own designs, we have worked with nuanced gestures enacted by "soft robots" with enhanced dexterity and "pleasant-to-touch" plush exteriors. By reducing operational complexity and production costs while enhancing customizability, our work creates an adaptable and accessible foundation for future tactile-based expressive robot research. Our goal is to provide a platform that allows researchers to independently construct or refine highly specific gestures and movements performed by social robots.

### Dull, Dirty, Dangerous: Understanding the Past, Present, and Future of a Key Motivation for Robotics
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04746v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04746v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04746v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04746v1)

In robotics, the concept of "dull, dirty, and dangerous" (DDD) work has been used to motivate where robots might be useful. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of robotics publications between 1980 and 2024 that mention DDD, and find that only 2.7% of publications define DDD and 8.7% of publications provide concrete examples of tasks or jobs that are DDD. We then review the social science literature on "dull," "dirty," and "dangerous" work to provide definitions and guidance on how to conceptualize DDD for robotics. Finally, we propose a framework that helps the robotics community consider the job context for our technology, encouraging a more informed perspective on how robotics may impact human labor.

### AGILE: Hand-Object Interaction Reconstruction from Video via Agentic Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04672v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04672v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04672v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04672v1)

Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

### From Vision to Assistance: Gaze and Vision-Enabled Adaptive Control for a Back-Support Exoskeleton
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04648v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04648v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04648v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04648v1)

Back-support exoskeletons have been proposed to mitigate spinal loading in industrial handling, yet their effectiveness critically depends on timely and context-aware assistance. Most existing approaches rely either on load-estimation techniques (e.g., EMG, IMU) or on vision systems that do not directly inform control. In this work, we present a vision-gated control framework for an active lumbar occupational exoskeleton that leverages egocentric vision with wearable gaze tracking. The proposed system integrates real-time grasp detection from a first-person YOLO-based perception system, a finite-state machine (FSM) for task progression, and a variable admittance controller to adapt torque delivery to both posture and object state. A user study with 15 participants performing stooping load lifting trials under three conditions (no exoskeleton, exoskeleton without vision, exoskeleton with vision) shows that vision-gated assistance significantly reduces perceived physical demand and improves fluency, trust, and comfort. Quantitative analysis reveals earlier and stronger assistance when vision is enabled, while questionnaire results confirm user preference for the vision-gated mode. These findings highlight the potential of egocentric vision to enhance the responsiveness, ergonomics, safety, and acceptance of back-support exoskeletons.

### Relational Scene Graphs for Object Grounding of Natural Language Commands
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04635v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04635v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04635v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04635v1)

Robots are finding wider adoption in human environments, increasing the need for natural human-robot interaction. However, understanding a natural language command requires the robot to infer the intended task and how to decompose it into executable actions, and to ground those actions in the robot's knowledge of the environment, including relevant objects, agents, and locations. This challenge can be addressed by combining the capabilities of Large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language with 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) for grounding inferred actions in a semantic representation of the environment. However, many 3DSGs lack explicit spatial relations between objects, even though humans often rely on these relations to describe an environment. This paper investigates whether incorporating open- or closed-vocabulary spatial relations into 3DSGs can improve the ability of LLMs to interpret natural language commands. To address this, we propose an LLM-based pipeline for target object grounding from open-vocabulary language commands and a vision language model (VLM)-based pipeline to add open-vocabulary spatial edges to 3DSGs from images captured while mapping. Finally, two LLMs are evaluated in a study assessing their performance on the downstream task of target object grounding. Our study demonstrates that explicit spatial relations improve the ability of LLMs to ground objects. Moreover, open-vocabulary relation generation with VLMs proves feasible from robot-captured images, but their advantage over closed-vocabulary relations is found to be limited.

### Radar-Inertial Odometry For Computationally Constrained Aerial Navigation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04631v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04631v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04631v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04631v1)

Recently, the progress in the radar sensing technology consisting in the miniaturization of the packages and increase in measuring precision has drawn the interest of the robotics research community. Indeed, a crucial task enabling autonomy in robotics is to precisely determine the pose of the robot in space. To fulfill this task sensor fusion algorithms are often used, in which data from one or several exteroceptive sensors like, for example, LiDAR, camera, laser ranging sensor or GNSS are fused together with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to obtain an estimate of the navigation states of the robot. Nonetheless, owing to their particular sensing principles, some exteroceptive sensors are often incapacitated in extreme environmental conditions, like extreme illumination or presence of fine particles in the environment like smoke or fog. Radars are largely immune to aforementioned factors thanks to the characteristics of electromagnetic waves they use. In this thesis, we present Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms to fuse the information from IMU and radar in order to estimate the navigation states of a (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) UAV capable of running on a portable resource-constrained embedded computer in real-time and making use of inexpensive, consumer-grade sensors. We present novel RIO approaches relying on the multi-state tightly-coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Factor Graphs (FG) fusing instantaneous velocities of and distances to 3D points delivered by a lightweight, low-cost, off-the-shelf Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with IMU readings. We also show a novel way to exploit advances in deep learning to retrieve 3D point correspondences in sparse and noisy radar point clouds.

### Can We Redesign a Shoulder Exosuit to Enhance Comfort and Usability Without Losing Assistance?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04625v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04625v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04625v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04625v1)

Reduced shoulder mobility limits upper-limb function and the performance of activities of daily living across a wide range of conditions. Wearable exosuits have shown promise in assisting arm elevation, reducing muscle effort, and supporting functional movements; however, comfort is rarely prioritized as an explicit design objective, despite it strongly affects real-life, long-term usage. This study presents a redesigned soft shoulder exosuit (Soft Shoulder v2) developed to address comfort-related limitations identified in our previous version, while preserving assistive performance. In parallel, assistance was also improved, shifting from the coronal plane to the sagittal plane to better support functionally relevant hand positioning. A controlled comparison between the previous (v1) and redesigned (v2) modules was conducted in eight healthy participants, who performed static holding, dynamic lifting, and a functional pick and place task. Muscle activity, kinematics, and user-reported outcomes were assessed. Both versions increased endurance time, reduced deltoid activation, and preserved transparency during unpowered shoulder elevation. However, the difference between them emerged most clearly during functional tasks and comfort evaluation. The redesigned module facilitated forward arm positioning and increased transverse plane mobility by up to 30 deg, without increasing muscular demand. User-reported outcomes further indicated a substantial improvement in wearability, with markedly lower perceived pressure and higher ratings in effectiveness, ease of use, and comfort compared to the previous design. Taken together, these findings show that targeted, user-centered design refinements can improve comfort and functional interaction without compromising assistive performance, advancing the development of soft exosuits suitable for prolonged and daily use.

### Act, Sense, Act: Learning Non-Markovian Active Perception Strategies from Large-Scale Egocentric Human Data

Achieving generalizable manipulation in unconstrained environments requires the robot to proactively resolve information uncertainty, i.e., the capability of active perception. However, existing methods are often confined in limited types of sensing behaviors, restricting their applicability to complex environments. In this work, we formalize active perception as a non-Markovian process driven by information gain and decision branching, providing a structured categorization of visual active perception paradigms. Building on this perspective, we introduce CoMe-VLA, a cognitive and memory-aware vision-language-action (VLA) framework that leverages large-scale human egocentric data to learn versatile exploration and manipulation priors. Our framework integrates a cognitive auxiliary head for autonomous sub-task transitions and a dual-track memory system to maintain consistent self and environmental awareness by fusing proprioceptive and visual temporal contexts. By aligning human and robot hand-eye coordination behaviors in a unified egocentric action space, we train the model progressively in three stages. Extensive experiments on a wheel-based humanoid have demonstrated strong robustness and adaptability of our proposed method across diverse long-horizon tasks spanning multiple active perception scenarios.

### A Unified Complementarity-based Approach for Rigid-Body Manipulation and Motion Prediction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04522v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04522v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04522v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04522v1)

Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires planners to reason jointly about free-space motion and sustained, frictional contact with the environment. Existing (local) planning and simulation frameworks typically separate these regimes or rely on simplified contact representations, particularly when modeling non-convex or distributed contact patches. Such approximations limit the fidelity of contact-mode transitions and hinder the robust execution of contact-rich behaviors in real time. This paper presents a unified discrete-time modeling framework for robotic manipulation that consistently captures both free motion and frictional contact within a single mathematical formalism (Unicomp). Building on complementarity-based rigid-body dynamics, we formulate free-space motion and contact interactions as coupled linear and nonlinear complementarity problems, enabling principled transitions between contact modes without enforcing fixed-contact assumptions. For planar patch contact, we derive a frictional contact model from the maximum power dissipation principle in which the set of admissible contact wrenches is represented by an ellipsoidal limit surface. This representation captures coupled force-moment effects, including torsional friction, while remaining agnostic to the underlying pressure distribution across the contact patch. The resulting formulation yields a discrete-time predictive model that relates generalized velocities and contact wrenches through quadratic constraints and is suitable for real-time optimization-based planning. Experimental results show that the proposed approach enables stable, physically consistent behavior at interactive speeds across tasks, from planar pushing to contact-rich whole-body maneuvers.

### S-MUSt3R: Sliding Multi-view 3D Reconstruction

The recent paradigm shift in 3D vision led to the rise of foundation models with remarkable capabilities in 3D perception from uncalibrated images. However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. This work proposes S-MUSt3R, a simple and efficient pipeline that extends the limits of foundation models for monocular 3D reconstruction. Our approach addresses the scalability bottleneck of foundation models through a simple strategy of sequence segmentation followed by segment alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without model retraining, we benefit from remarkable 3D reconstruction capacities of MUSt3R model and achieve trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods with more complex architecture. We evaluate S-MUSt3R on TUM, 7-Scenes and proprietary robot navigation datasets and show that S-MUSt3R runs successfully on long RGB sequences and produces accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging the MUSt3R model for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, with an important advantage of making predictions directly in the metric space.

### TACO: Temporal Consensus Optimization for Continual Neural Mapping
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04516v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04516v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04516v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04516v1)

Neural implicit mapping has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic navigation and scene understanding. However, real-world robotic deployment requires continual adaptation to changing environments under strict memory and computation constraints, which existing mapping systems fail to support. Most prior methods rely on replaying historical observations to preserve consistency and assume static scenes. As a result, they cannot adapt to continual learning in dynamic robotic settings. To address these challenges, we propose TACO (TemporAl Consensus Optimization), a replay-free framework for continual neural mapping. We reformulate mapping as a temporal consensus optimization problem, where we treat past model snapshots as temporal neighbors. Intuitively, our approach resembles a model consulting its own past knowledge. We update the current map by enforcing weighted consensus with historical representations. Our method allows reliable past geometry to constrain optimization while permitting unreliable or outdated regions to be revised in response to new observations. TACO achieves a balance between memory efficiency and adaptability without storing or replaying previous data. Through extensive simulated and real-world experiments, we show that TACO robustly adapts to scene changes, and consistently outperforms other continual learning baselines.

### EgoActor: Grounding Task Planning into Spatial-aware Egocentric Actions for Humanoid Robots via Visual-Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04515v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04515v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04515v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04515v1)

Deploying humanoid robots in real-world settings is fundamentally challenging, as it demands tight integration of perception, locomotion, and manipulation under partial-information observations and dynamically changing environments. As well as transitioning robustly between sub-tasks of different types. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a novel task - EgoActing, which requires directly grounding high-level instructions into various, precise, spatially aware humanoid actions. We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.

### The Supportiveness-Safety Tradeoff in LLM Well-Being Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04487v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04487v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04487v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04487v1)

Large language models (LLMs) are being integrated into socially assistive robots (SARs) and other conversational agents providing mental health and well-being support. These agents are often designed to sound empathic and supportive in order to maximize user's engagement, yet it remains unclear how increasing the level of supportive framing in system prompts influences safety relevant behavior. We evaluated 6 LLMs across 3 system prompts with varying levels of supportiveness on 80 synthetic queries spanning 4 well-being domains (1440 responses). An LLM judge framework, validated against human ratings, assessed safety and care quality. Moderately supportive prompts improved empathy and constructive support while maintaining safety. In contrast, strongly validating prompts significantly degraded safety and, in some cases, care across all domains, with substantial variation across models. We discuss implications for prompt design, model selection, and domain specific safeguards in SARs deployment.

### Robot-Assisted Group Tours for Blind People

Group interactions are essential to social functioning, yet effective engagement relies on the ability to recognize and interpret visual cues, making such engagement a significant challenge for blind people. In this paper, we investigate how a mobile robot can support group interactions for blind people. We used the scenario of a guided tour with mixed-visual groups involving blind and sighted visitors. Based on insights from an interview study with blind people (n=5) and museum experts (n=5), we designed and prototyped a robotic system that supported blind visitors to join group tours. We conducted a field study in a science museum where each blind participant (n=8) joined a group tour with one guide and two sighted participants (n=8). Findings indicated users' sense of safety from the robot's navigational support, concerns in the group participation, and preferences for obtaining environmental information. We present design implications for future robotic systems to support blind people's mixed-visual group participation.

### Gust Estimation and Rejection with a Disturbance Observer for Proprioceptive Underwater Soft Morphing Wings

Unmanned underwater vehicles are increasingly employed for maintenance and surveying tasks at sea, but their operation in shallow waters is often hindered by hydrodynamic disturbances such as waves, currents, and turbulence. These unsteady flows can induce rapid changes in direction and speed, compromising vehicle stability and manoeuvrability. Marine organisms contend with such conditions by combining proprioceptive feedback with flexible fins and tails to reject disturbances. Inspired by this strategy, we propose soft morphing wings endowed with proprioceptive sensing to mitigate environmental perturbations. The wing's continuous deformation provides a natural means to infer dynamic disturbances: sudden changes in camber directly reflect variations in the oncoming flow. By interpreting this proprioceptive signal, a disturbance observer can reconstruct flow parameters in real time. To enable this, we develop and experimentally validate a dynamic model of a hydraulically actuated soft wing with controllable camber. We then show that curvature-based sensing allows accurate estimation of disturbances in the angle of attack. Finally, we demonstrate that a controller leveraging these proprioceptive estimates can reject disturbances in the lift response of the soft wing. By combining proprioceptive sensing with a disturbance observer, this technique mirrors biological strategies and provides a pathway for soft underwater vehicles to maintain stability in hazardous environments.

### Integrated Exploration and Sequential Manipulation on Scene Graph with LLM-based Situated Replanning

In partially known environments, robots must combine exploration to gather information with task planning for efficient execution. To address this challenge, we propose EPoG, an Exploration-based sequential manipulation Planning framework on Scene Graphs. EPoG integrates a graph-based global planner with a Large Language Model (LLM)-based situated local planner, continuously updating a belief graph using observations and LLM predictions to represent known and unknown objects. Action sequences are generated by computing graph edit operations between the goal and belief graphs, ordered by temporal dependencies and movement costs. This approach seamlessly combines exploration and sequential manipulation planning. In ablation studies across 46 realistic household scenes and 5 long-horizon daily object transportation tasks, EPoG achieved a success rate of 91.3%, reducing travel distance by 36.1% on average. Furthermore, a physical mobile manipulator successfully executed complex tasks in unknown and dynamic environments, demonstrating EPoG's potential for real-world applications.

### HoRD: Robust Humanoid Control via History-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning and Online Distillation

2026/02/04 10:41 GTM

Humanoid robots can suffer significant performance drops under small changes in dynamics, task specifications, or environment setup. We propose HoRD, a two-stage learning framework for robust humanoid control under domain shift. First, we train a high-performance teacher policy via history-conditioned reinforcement learning, where the policy infers latent dynamics context from recent state--action trajectories to adapt online to diverse randomized dynamics. Second, we perform online distillation to transfer the teacher's robust control capabilities into a transformer-based student policy that operates on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories. By combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation, HoRD enables a single policy to adapt zero-shot to unseen domains without per-domain retraining. Extensive experiments show HoRD outperforms strong baselines in robustness and transfer, especially under unseen domains and external perturbations.

### Quantile Transfer for Reliable Operating Point Selection in Visual Place Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04401v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04401v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04401v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04401v1)

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a key component for localisation in GNSS-denied environments, but its performance critically depends on selecting an image matching threshold (operating point) that balances precision and recall. Thresholds are typically hand-tuned offline for a specific environment and fixed during deployment, leading to degraded performance under environmental change. We propose a method that, given a user-defined precision requirement, automatically selects the operating point of a VPR system to maximise recall. The method uses a small calibration traversal with known correspondences and transfers thresholds to deployment via quantile normalisation of similarity score distributions. This quantile transfer ensures that thresholds remain stable across calibration sizes and query subsets, making the method robust to sampling variability. Experiments with multiple state-of-the-art VPR techniques and datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering up to 25% higher recall in high-precision operating regimes. The method eliminates manual tuning by adapting to new environments and generalising across operating conditions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

### Safe and Stylized Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving via Diffusion Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04329v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.04329v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04329v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.04329v1)

Achieving safe and stylized trajectory planning in complex real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO. Real-vehicle closed-loop tests further confirm that SDD Planner maintains high safety standards while aligning with preset driving styles, validating its practical applicability for real-world deployment.

### GeneralVLA: Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning

Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm integrating perception, decision-making, and control within a unified learning framework. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance the robustness and generalization of end-to-end driving models in diverse and unseen scenarios. However, existing VLM-based approaches still face challenges, including suboptimal lane perception, language understanding biases, and difficulties in handling corner cases. To address these issues, we propose AppleVLM, an advanced perception and planning-enhanced VLM model for robust end-to-end driving. AppleVLM introduces a novel vision encoder and a planning strategy encoder to improve perception and decision-making. Firstly, the vision encoder fuses spatial-temporal information from multi-view images across multiple timesteps using a deformable transformer mechanism, enhancing robustness to camera variations and facilitating scalable deployment across different vehicle platforms. Secondly, unlike traditional VLM-based approaches, AppleVLM introduces a dedicated planning modality that encodes explicit Bird's-Eye-View spatial information, mitigating language biases in navigation instructions. Finally, a VLM decoder fine-tuned by a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought integrates vision, language, and planning features to output robust driving waypoints. We evaluate AppleVLM in closed-loop experiments on two CARLA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art driving performance. Furthermore, we deploy AppleVLM on an AGV platform and successfully showcase real-world end-to-end autonomous driving in complex outdoor environments.

Traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems often face limitations including coarse rendering quality, insufficient recovery of scene details, and poor robustness in dynamic environments. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its efficient explicit representation and high-quality rendering capabilities, offers a new reconstruction paradigm for SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews key technical approaches for integrating 3DGS with SLAM. We analyze performance optimization of representative methods across four critical dimensions: rendering quality, tracking accuracy, reconstruction speed, and memory consumption, delving into their design principles and breakthroughs. Furthermore, we examine methods for enhancing the robustness of 3DGS-SLAM in complex environments such as motion blur and dynamic environments. Finally, we discuss future challenges and development trends in this area. This survey aims to provide a technical reference for researchers and foster the development of next-generation SLAM systems characterized by high fidelity, efficiency, and robustness.

Robotic manipulation continues to be a challenge, and imitation learning (IL) enables robots to learn tasks from expert demonstrations. Current IL methods typically rely on fixed camera setups, where cameras are manually positioned in static locations, imposing significant limitations on adaptability and coverage. Inspired by human active perception, where humans dynamically adjust their viewpoint to capture the most relevant and least noisy information, we propose MAE-Select, a novel framework for active viewpoint selection in single-camera robotic systems. MAE-Select fully leverages pre-trained multi-view masked autoencoder representations and dynamically selects the next most informative viewpoint at each time chunk without requiring labeled viewpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAE-Select improves the capabilities of single-camera systems and, in some cases, even surpasses multi-camera setups. The project will be available at https://mae-select.github.io.

Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.
  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc.
