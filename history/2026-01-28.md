### DuwatBench: Bridging Language and Visual Heritage through an Arabic Calligraphy Benchmark for Multimodal Understanding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19898v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19898v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19898v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19898v1)

Arabic calligraphy represents one of the richest visual traditions of the Arabic language, blending linguistic meaning with artistic form. Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area. Our dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/DuwatBench) and evaluation suit (https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/DuwatBench) are publicly available.

### VGGT-SLAM 2.0: Real time Dense Feed-forward Scene Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19887v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19887v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19887v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19887v1)

We present VGGT-SLAM 2.0, a real time RGB feed-forward SLAM system which substantially improves upon VGGT-SLAM for incrementally aligning submaps created from VGGT. Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.

### SONIC: Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19884v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19884v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19884v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19884v1)

2026/01/27 18:51 GTM

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.

### EgoHandICL: Egocentric 3D Hand Reconstruction with In-Context Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19850v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19850v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19850v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19850v1)

Robust 3D hand reconstruction in egocentric vision is challenging due to depth ambiguity, self-occlusion, and complex hand-object interactions. Prior methods mitigate these issues by scaling training data or adding auxiliary cues, but they often struggle in unseen contexts. We present EgoHandICL, the first in-context learning (ICL) framework for 3D hand reconstruction that improves semantic alignment, visual consistency, and robustness under challenging egocentric conditions. EgoHandICL introduces complementary exemplar retrieval guided by vision-language models (VLMs), an ICL-tailored tokenizer for multimodal context, and a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based architecture trained with hand-guided geometric and perceptual objectives. Experiments on ARCTIC and EgoExo4D show consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate real-world generalization and improve EgoVLM hand-object interaction reasoning by using reconstructed hands as visual prompts.

### HexFormer: Hyperbolic Vision Transformer with Exponential Map Aggregation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19849v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19849v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19849v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19849v1)

2026/01/27 17:56 GTM

Data across modalities such as images, text, and graphs often contains hierarchical and relational structures, which are challenging to model within Euclidean geometry. Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.

### Query-Guided Spatial-Temporal-Frequency Interaction for Music Audio-Visual Question Answering
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19821v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19821v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19821v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19821v1)

2026/01/27 17:24 GTM

Audio--Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires jointly reasoning over audio, visual, and textual information in a given video to answer natural language questions. Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication.

### Youtu-VL: Unleashing Visual Potential via Unified Vision-Language Supervision
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19798v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19798v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19798v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19798v1)

2026/01/27 17:01 GTM

Despite the significant advancements represented by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current architectures often exhibit limitations in retaining fine-grained visual information, leading to coarse-grained multimodal comprehension. We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.

### Diffusion for De-Occlusion: Accessory-Aware Diffusion Inpainting for Robust Ear Biometric Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19795v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19795v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19795v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19795v1)

2026/01/27 16:55 GTM

Ear occlusions (arising from the presence of ear accessories such as earrings and earphones) can negatively impact performance in ear-based biometric recognition systems, especially in unconstrained imaging circumstances. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.

### GeoDiff3D: Self-Supervised 3D Scene Generation with Geometry-Constrained 2D Diffusion Guidance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19785v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19785v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19785v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19785v1)

2026/01/27 16:47 GTM

3D scene generation is a core technology for gaming, film/VFX, and VR/AR. Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction.

### PaW-ViT: A Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer for Robust Ear Verification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19771v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19771v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19771v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19771v1)

2026/01/27 16:34 GTM

The rectangular tokens common to vision transformer methods for visual recognition can strongly affect performance of these methods due to incorporation of information outside the objects to be recognized. This paper introduces PaW-ViT, Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer, a preprocessing approach rooted in anatomical knowledge that normalizes ear images to enhance the efficacy of ViT. By accurately aligning token boundaries to detected ear feature boundaries, PaW-ViT obtains greater robustness to shape, size, and pose variation. By aligning feature boundaries to natural ear curvature, it produces more consistent token representations for various morphologies. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PaW-ViT on various ViT models (ViT-T, ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) and yield reasonable alignment robustness to variation in shape, size, and pose. Our work aims to solve the disconnect between ear biometric morphological variation and transformer architecture positional sensitivity, presenting a possible avenue for authentication schemes.

### WaterClear-GS: Optical-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Underwater Reconstruction and Restoration
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19753v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19753v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19753v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19753v1)

2026/01/27 16:14 GTM

Underwater 3D reconstruction and appearance restoration are hindered by the complex optical properties of water, such as wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods struggle with slow rendering speeds and suboptimal color restoration, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) inherently lacks the capability to model complex volumetric scattering effects. To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that WaterClear-GS achieves outstanding performance on both novel view synthesis (NVS) and underwater image restoration (UIR) tasks, while maintaining real-time rendering. The code will be available at https://buaaxrzhang.github.io/WaterClear-GS/.

### Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Missing Modality Completion in Product Catalogues
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19750v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19750v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19750v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19750v1)

2026/01/27 16:13 GTM

Missing-modality information on e-commerce platforms, such as absent product images or textual descriptions, often arises from annotation errors or incomplete metadata, impairing both product presentation and downstream applications such as recommendation systems. Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark.
  We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks. We also explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with this task. GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion. Overall, these findings expose the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation and represent an early step toward more effective missing-modality product completion.

### Interpretable and backpropagation-free Green Learning for efficient multi-task echocardiographic segmentation and classification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19743v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19743v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19743v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19743v1)

Echocardiography is a cornerstone for managing heart failure (HF), with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) being a critical metric for guiding therapy. However, manual LVEF assessment suffers from high inter-observer variability, while existing Deep Learning (DL) models are often computationally intensive and data-hungry "black boxes" that impede clinical trust and adoption. Here, we propose a backpropagation-free multi-task Green Learning (MTGL) framework that performs simultaneous Left Ventricle (LV) segmentation and LVEF classification. Our framework integrates an unsupervised VoxelHop encoder for hierarchical spatio-temporal feature extraction with a multi-level regression decoder and an XG-Boost classifier. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our MTGL model achieves state-of-the-art classification and segmentation performance, attaining a classification accuracy of 94.3% and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.912, significantly outperforming several advanced 3D DL models. Crucially, our model achieves this with over an order of magnitude fewer parameters, demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency. This work demonstrates that the GL paradigm can deliver highly accurate, efficient, and interpretable solutions for complex medical image analysis, paving the way for more sustainable and trustworthy artificial intelligence in clinical practice.

### DiffStyle3D: Consistent 3D Gaussian Stylization via Attention Optimization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19717v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19717v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19717v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19717v1)

3D style transfer enables the creation of visually expressive 3D content, enriching the visual appearance of 3D scenes and objects. However, existing VGG- and CLIP-based methods struggle to model multi-view consistency within the model itself, while diffusion-based approaches can capture such consistency but rely on denoising directions, leading to unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle3D, a novel diffusion-based paradigm for 3DGS style transfer that directly optimizes in the latent space. Specifically, we introduce an Attention-Aware Loss that performs style transfer by aligning style features in the self-attention space, while preserving original content through content feature alignment. Inspired by the geometric invariance of 3D stylization, we propose a Geometry-Guided Multi-View Consistency method that integrates geometric information into self-attention to enable cross-view correspondence modeling. Based on geometric information, we additionally construct a geometry-aware mask to prevent redundant optimization in overlapping regions across views, which further improves multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show that DiffStyle3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher stylization quality and visual realism.

### Self-Supervised Weight Templates for Scalable Vision Model Initialization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19694v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19694v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19694v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19694v1)

The increasing scale and complexity of modern model parameters underscore the importance of pre-trained models. However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization. Extensive experiments on \textsc{classification}, \textsc{detection}, \textsc{segmentation} and \textsc{generation} tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SWEET for initializing variable-sized vision models.

### DSVM-UNet : Enhancing VM-UNet with Dual Self-distillation for Medical Image Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19690v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19690v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19690v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19690v1)

2026/01/27 15:06 GTM

Vision Mamba models have been extensively researched in various fields, which address the limitations of previous models by effectively managing long-range dependencies with a linear-time overhead. Several prospective studies have further designed Vision Mamba based on UNet(VM-UNet) for medical image segmentation. These approaches primarily focus on optimizing architectural designs by creating more complex structures to enhance the model's ability to perceive semantic features. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the model by Dual Self-distillation for VM-UNet (DSVM-UNet) without any complex architectural designs. To achieve this goal, we develop double self-distillation methods to align the features at both the global and local levels. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISIC2017, ISIC2018, and Synapse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/RoryShao/DSVM-UNet.git.

### Video-KTR: Reinforcing Video Reasoning via Key Token Attribution
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19686v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19686v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19686v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19686v1)

2026/01/27 15:02 GTM

Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong potential for enhancing reasoning in multimodal large language models, yet existing video reasoning methods often rely on coarse sequence-level rewards or single-factor token selection, neglecting fine-grained links among visual inputs, temporal dynamics, and linguistic outputs, limiting both accuracy and interpretability. We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates. Overall, Video-KTR improves accuracy and interpretability, offering a simple, drop-in extension to RL for complex video reasoning. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/zywang0104/Video-KTR.

### SharpNet: Enhancing MLPs to Represent Functions with Controlled Non-differentiability
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19683v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19683v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19683v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19683v1)

2026/01/27 15:01 GTM

Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a standard tool for learning and function approximation, but they inherently yield outputs that are globally smooth. As a result, they struggle to represent functions that are continuous yet deliberately non-differentiable (i.e., with prescribed $C^0$ sharp features) without relying on ad hoc post-processing. We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations highlight the benefits of our approach.

### A new Image Similarity Metric for a Perceptual and Transparent Geometric and Chromatic Assessment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19680v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19680v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19680v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19680v1)

2026/01/27 14:59 GTM

In the literature, several studies have shown that state-of-the-art image similarity metrics are not perceptual metrics; moreover, they have difficulty evaluating images, especially when texture distortion is also present. In this work, we propose a new perceptual metric composed of two terms. The first term evaluates the dissimilarity between the textures of two images using Earth Mover's Distance. The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors. We have shown that our metric outperforms the state of the art, especially when images contain shape distortions, confirming also its greater perceptiveness. Furthermore, although deep black-box metrics could be very accurate, they only provide similarity scores between two images, without explaining their main differences and similarities. Our metric, on the other hand, provides visual explanations to support the calculated score, making the similarity assessment transparent and justified.

### KeepLoRA: Continual Learning with Residual Gradient Adaptation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19659v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19659v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19659v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19659v1)

2026/01/27 14:38 GTM

Continual learning for pre-trained vision-language models requires balancing three competing objectives: retaining pre-trained knowledge, preserving knowledge from a sequence of learned tasks, and maintaining the plasticity to acquire new knowledge. This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features. Our theoretical and empirical analyses confirm that KeepLoRA balances the three objectives and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Low-altitude vision systems are becoming a critical infrastructure for smart city governance. However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components. We believe our work offers a new perspective and foundation for future studies on management-aware low-altitude vision-language systems.

### The role of self-supervised pretraining in differentially private medical image analysis

Differential privacy (DP) provides formal protection for sensitive data but typically incurs substantial losses in diagnostic performance. Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints. The results establish initialization strategy as a central determinant of utility, fairness, and generalization in differentially private medical imaging.

### GMS-CAVP: Improving Audio-Video Correspondence with Multi-Scale Contrastive and Generative Pretraining
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19606v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19606v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19606v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19606v1)

Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.

### Localized Latent Editing for Dose-Response Modeling in Botulinum Toxin Injection Planning

Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections are the gold standard for managing facial asymmetry and aesthetic rejuvenation, yet determining the optimal dosage remains largely intuitive, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. We propose a localized latent editing framework that simulates Botulinum Toxin injection effects for injection planning through dose-response modeling. Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes. While biological variability limits absolute precision, we introduce a hybrid "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow where clinicians interactively refine simulations, bridging the gap between pathological reconstruction and cosmetic planning.

### ScenePilot-Bench: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Evaluation of Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving

2026/01/27 13:17 GTM

In this paper, we introduce ScenePilot-Bench, a large-scale first-person driving benchmark designed to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving scenarios. ScenePilot-Bench is built upon ScenePilot-4K, a diverse dataset comprising 3,847 hours of driving videos, annotated with multi-granularity information including scene descriptions, risk assessments, key participant identification, ego trajectories, and camera parameters. The benchmark features a four-axis evaluation suite that assesses VLM capabilities in scene understanding, spatial perception, motion planning, and GPT-Score, with safety-aware metrics and cross-region generalization settings. We benchmark representative VLMs on ScenePilot-Bench, providing empirical analyses that clarify current performance boundaries and identify gaps for driving-oriented reasoning. ScenePilot-Bench offers a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing VLMs in safety-critical autonomous driving contexts.

### QuaMo: Quaternion Motions for Vision-based 3D Human Kinematics Capture
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19580v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19580v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19580v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19580v1)

Vision-based 3D human motion capture from videos remains a challenge in computer vision. Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST. The code is available at https://github.com/cuongle1206/QuaMo

### MaDiS: Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models for Sign Language Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19577v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19577v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19577v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19577v1)

Sign language generation (SLG) aims to translate written texts into expressive sign motions, bridging communication barriers for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%. Code and models will be released on our project page.

We release the S3LI Vulcano dataset, a multi-modal dataset towards development and benchmarking of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and place recognition algorithms that rely on visual and LiDAR modalities. Several sequences are recorded on the volcanic island of Vulcano, from the Aeolian Islands in Sicily, Italy. The sequences provide users with data from a variety of environments, textures and terrains, including basaltic or iron-rich rocks, geological formations from old lava channels, as well as dry vegetation and water. The data (rmc.dlr.de/s3li_dataset) is accompanied by an open source toolkit (github.com/DLR-RM/s3li-toolkit) providing tools for generating ground truth poses as well as preparation of labelled samples for place recognition tasks.

### A Non-Invasive 3D Gait Analysis Framework for Quantifying Psychomotor Retardation in Major Depressive Disorder
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19526v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19526v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19526v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19526v1)

Predicting the status of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) from objective, non-invasive methods is an active research field. Yet, extracting automatically objective, interpretable features for a detailed analysis of the patient state remains largely unexplored.
  Among MDD's symptoms, Psychomotor retardation (PMR) is a core item, yet its clinical assessment remains largely subjective. While 3D motion capture offers an objective alternative, its reliance on specialized hardware often precludes routine clinical use. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive computational framework that transforms monocular RGB video into clinically relevant 3D gait kinematics. Our pipeline uses Gravity-View Coordinates along with a novel trajectory-correction algorithm that leverages the closed-loop topology of our adapted Timed Up and Go (TUG) protocol to mitigate monocular depth errors. This novel pipeline enables the extraction of 297 explicit gait biomechanical biomarkers from a single camera capture.
  To address the challenges of small clinical datasets, we introduce a stability-based machine learning framework that identifies robust motor signatures while preventing overfitting. Validated on the CALYPSO dataset, our method achieves an 83.3% accuracy in detecting PMR and explains 64% of the variance in overall depression severity (R^2=0.64). Notably, our study reveals a strong link between reduced ankle propulsion and restricted pelvic mobility to the depressive motor phenotype. These results demonstrate that physical movement serves as a robust proxy for the cognitive state, offering a transparent and scalable tool for the objective monitoring of depression in standard clinical environments.

### Mocap Anywhere: Towards Pairwise-Distance based Motion Capture in the Wild (for the Wild)
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19519v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19519v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19519v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19519v1)

2026/01/27 11:58 GTM

We introduce a novel motion capture system that reconstructs full-body 3D motion using only sparse pairwise distance (PWD) measurements from body-mounted(UWB) sensors. Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild. Our empirical analysis highlights its potential for scalable, low-cost, and general purpose motion capture in real-world settings.

### Bridging Information Asymmetry: A Hierarchical Framework for Deterministic Blind Face Restoration
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19506v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19506v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19506v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19506v1)

2026/01/27 11:50 GTM

Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.

### Cortex-Grounded Diffusion Models for Brain Image Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19498v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19498v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19498v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19498v1)

Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.

### Fast Converging 3D Gaussian Splatting for 1-Minute Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19489v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19489v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19489v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19489v1)

2026/01/27 11:20 GTM

We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition.

### Entropy-Guided k-Guard Sampling for Long-Horizon Autoregressive Video Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19488v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19488v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19488v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19488v1)

2026/01/27 11:19 GTM

Autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved significant successes in LLMs, inspiring explorations for video generation. In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies.

### Dynamic Worlds, Dynamic Humans: Generating Virtual Human-Scene Interaction Motion in Dynamic Scenes

Scenes are continuously undergoing dynamic changes in the real world. However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings.

### Towards Gold-Standard Depth Estimation for Tree Branches in UAV Forestry: Benchmarking Deep Stereo Matching Methods
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19461v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19461v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19461v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19461v1)

2026/01/27 10:45 GTM

Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.

### DSTCS: Dual-Student Teacher Framework with Segment Anything Model for Semi-Supervised Pubic Symphysis Fetal Head Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19446v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19446v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19446v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19446v1)

2026/01/27 10:32 GTM

Segmentation of the pubic symphysis and fetal head (PSFH) is a critical procedure in intrapartum monitoring and is essential for evaluating labor progression and identifying potential delivery complications. However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice.

### RoamScene3D: Immersive Text-to-3D Scene Generation via Adaptive Object-aware Roaming
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19433v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19433v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19433v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19433v1)

Generating immersive 3D scenes from texts is a core task in computer vision, crucial for applications in virtual reality and game development. Despite the promise of leveraging 2D diffusion priors, existing methods suffer from spatial blindness and rely on predefined trajectories that fail to exploit the inner relationships among salient objects. Consequently, these approaches are unable to comprehend the semantic layout, preventing them from exploring the scene adaptively to infer occluded content. Moreover, current inpainting models operate in 2D image space, struggling to plausibly fill holes caused by camera motion. To address these limitations, we propose RoamScene3D, a novel framework that bridges the gap between semantic guidance and spatial generation. Our method reasons about the semantic relations among objects and produces consistent and photorealistic scenes. Specifically, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to construct a scene graph that encodes object relations, guiding the camera to perceive salient object boundaries and plan an adaptive roaming trajectory. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitations of static 2D priors, we introduce a Motion-Injected Inpainting model that is fine-tuned on a synthetic panoramic dataset integrating authentic camera trajectories, making it adaptive to camera motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with semantic reasoning and geometric constraints, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in producing consistent and photorealistic scenes. Our code is available at https://github.com/JS-CHU/RoamScene3D.

### Unveiling Perceptual Artifacts: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Interpretable AI-Generated Image Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19430v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19430v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19430v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19430v1)

Current AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detection approaches predominantly rely on binary classification to distinguish real from synthetic images, often lacking interpretable or convincing evidence to substantiate their decisions. This limitation stems from existing AIGI detection benchmarks, which, despite featuring a broad collection of synthetic images, remain restricted in their coverage of artifact diversity and lack detailed, localized annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level. (2) While AIGI detectors can be trained to identify specific artifacts, they still substantially base their judgment on uninterpretable features. (3) Explicitly aligning model attention with artifact regions can increase the interpretability and generalization of detectors. The data and code are available at: https://github.com/Coxy7/X-AIGD.

Obstructions such as raindrops, fences, or dust degrade captured images, especially when mechanical cleaning is infeasible. Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands. This optical signal is further enhanced using a neural network. Our learned split-spectrum metalens achieves broadband and obstruction-free imaging with relative PSNR gains of 32.29% and improves object detection and semantic segmentation accuracies with absolute gains of +13.54% mAP, +48.45% IoU, and +20.35% mIoU over a conventional hyperbolic design. This promises robust obstruction-free sensing and vision for space-constrained systems, such as mobile robots, drones, and endoscopes.

Using multiple open-access models trained on public datasets, we developed Tri-Reader, a comprehensive, freely available pipeline that integrates lung segmentation, nodule detection, and malignancy classification into a unified tri-stage workflow. The pipeline is designed to prioritize sensitivity while reducing the candidate burden for annotators. To ensure accuracy and generalizability across diverse practices, we evaluated Tri-Reader on multiple internal and external datasets as compared with expert annotations and dataset-provided reference standards.

Accessing high-quality, open-access dermatopathology image datasets for learning and cross-referencing is a common challenge for clinicians and dermatopathology trainees. To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6\% for the deep learning approach, 61.0\% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4\% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists. Using our dataset as a challenging task, we found the current image analysis algorithm from OpenAI inadequate for analyzing dermatopathology images. In conclusion, we have developed a large, peer-reviewed, open-access dermatopathology image dataset, DermpathNet, which features a semi-automated curation workflow.

### Pareto-Guided Optimization for Uncertainty-Aware Medical Image Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19365v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19365v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19365v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19365v1)

Uncertainty in medical image segmentation is inherently non-uniform, with boundary regions exhibiting substantially higher ambiguity than interior areas. Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions.

[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19349v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19349v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19349v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19349v1)

2026/01/27 08:29 GTM

Multimodal MRI is essential for brain tumor segmentation, yet missing modalities in clinical practice cause existing methods to exhibit >40% performance variance across modality combinations, rendering them clinically unreliable. We propose AMGFormer, achieving significantly improved stability through three synergistic modules: (1) QuadIntegrator Bridge (QIB) enabling spatially adaptive fusion maintaining consistent predictions regardless of available modalities, (2) Multi-Granular Attention Orchestrator (MGAO) focusing on pathological regions to reduce background sensitivity, and (3) Modality Quality-Aware Enhancement (MQAE) preventing error propagation from corrupted sequences. On BraTS 2018, our method achieves 89.33% WT, 82.70% TC, 67.23% ET Dice scores with <0.5% variance across 15 modality combinations, solving the stability crisis. Single-modality ET segmentation shows 40-81% relative improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The method generalizes to BraTS 2020/2021, achieving up to 92.44% WT, 89.91% TC, 84.57% ET. The model demonstrates potential for clinical deployment with 1.2s inference. Code: https://github.com/guochengxiangives/AMGFormer.

### Innovator-VL: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Scientific Discovery
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19325v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19325v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19325v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19325v1)

2026/01/27 08:12 GTM

We present Innovator-VL, a scientific multimodal large language model designed to advance understanding and reasoning across diverse scientific domains while maintaining excellent performance on general vision tasks. Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling. (iii) Third, Innovator-VL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving competitive performance on general vision, multimodal reasoning, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific alignment can be integrated into a unified model without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Our practices suggest that efficient, reproducible, and high-performing scientific multimodal models can be built even without large-scale data, providing a practical foundation for future research.

### Perception-to-Pursuit: Track-Centric Temporal Reasoning for Open-World Drone Detection and Autonomous Chasing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19318v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19318v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19318v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19318v1)

2026/01/27 07:57 GTM

Autonomous drone pursuit requires not only detecting drones but also predicting their trajectories in a manner that enables kinematically feasible interception. Existing tracking methods optimize for prediction accuracy but ignore pursuit feasibility, resulting in trajectories that are physically impossible to intercept 99.9% of the time. We propose Perception-to-Pursuit (P2P), a track-centric temporal reasoning framework that bridges detection and actionable pursuit planning. Our method represents drone motion as compact 8-dimensional tokens capturing velocity, acceleration, scale, and smoothness, enabling a 12-frame causal transformer to reason about future behavior. We introduce the Intercept Success Rate (ISR) metric to measure pursuit feasibility under realistic interceptor constraints. Evaluated on the Anti-UAV-RGBT dataset with 226 real drone sequences, P2P achieves 28.12 pixel average displacement error and 0.597 ISR, representing a 77% improvement in trajectory prediction and 597x improvement in pursuit feasibility over tracking-only baselines, while maintaining perfect drone classification accuracy (100%). Our work demonstrates that temporal reasoning over motion patterns enables both accurate prediction and actionable pursuit planning.

### Instance-Guided Radar Depth Estimation for 3D Object Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19314v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19314v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19314v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19314v1)

2026/01/27 07:53 GTM

Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.

### Beyond Shadows: A Large-Scale Benchmark and Multi-Stage Framework for High-Fidelity Facial Shadow Removal
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19309v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19309v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19309v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19309v1)

2026/01/27 07:48 GTM

Facial shadows often degrade image quality and the performance of vision algorithms. Existing methods struggle to remove shadows while preserving texture, especially under complex lighting conditions, and they lack real-world paired datasets for training. We present the Augmented Shadow Face in the Wild (ASFW) dataset, the first large-scale real-world dataset for facial shadow removal, containing 1,081 paired shadow and shadow-free images created via a professional Photoshop workflow. ASFW offers photorealistic shadow variations and accurate ground truths, bridging the gap between synthetic and real domains. Deep models trained on ASFW demonstrate improved shadow removal in real-world conditions. We also introduce the Face Shadow Eraser (FSE) method to showcase the effectiveness of the dataset. Experiments demonstrate that ASFW enhances the performance of facial shadow removal models, setting new standards for this task.

### ProMist-5K: A Comprehensive Dataset for Digital Emulation of Cinematic Pro-Mist Filter Effects
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19295v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19295v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19295v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19295v1)

Pro-Mist filters are widely used in cinematography for their ability to create soft halation, lower contrast, and produce a distinctive, atmospheric style. These effects are difficult to reproduce digitally due to the complex behavior of light diffusion. We present ProMist-5K, a dataset designed to support cinematic style emulation. It is built using a physically inspired pipeline in a scene-referred linear space and includes 20,000 high-resolution image pairs across four configurations, covering two filter densities (1/2 and 1/8) and two focal lengths (20mm and 50mm). Unlike general style datasets, ProMist-5K focuses on realistic glow and highlight diffusion effects. Multiple blur layers and carefully tuned weighting are used to model the varying intensity and spread of optical diffusion. The dataset provides a consistent and controllable target domain that supports various image translation models and learning paradigms. Experiments show that the dataset works well across different training settings and helps capture both subtle and strong cinematic appearances. ProMist-5K offers a practical and physically grounded resource for film-inspired image transformation, bridging the gap between digital flexibility and traditional lens aesthetics. The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yingtielei/promist5k.

### A Multi-View Consistency Framework with Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19266v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19266v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19266v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19266v1)

Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) leverages knowledge from a fully labeled source domain to classify data in a partially labeled target domain. Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-domain affinity learning aimed at aligning features of the same class across different domains, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods on two standard domain adaptation datasets, DomainNet and Office-Home. Combining unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning offers indispensable contributions to the industrial sector by enhancing model adaptability, reducing annotation costs, and improving performance.

### Handcrafted Feature Fusion for Reliable Detection of AI-Generated Images
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19262v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19262v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19262v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19262v1)

The rapid progress of generative models has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising concerns about authenticity and trust in digital media. Detecting such fake content reliably is an urgent challenge. While deep learning approaches dominate current literature, handcrafted features remain attractive for their interpretability, efficiency, and generalizability. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit. These findings highlight the continued relevance of carefully engineered features and ensemble learning for detecting synthetic images, particularly in contexts where interpretability and computational efficiency are critical.

### TIGaussian: Disentangle Gaussians for Spatial-Awared Text-Image-3D Alignment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19247v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19247v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19247v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19247v1)

While visual-language models have profoundly linked features between texts and images, the incorporation of 3D modality data, such as point clouds and 3D Gaussians, further enables pretraining for 3D-related tasks, e.g., cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot classification, and scene recognition. As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TIGaussian in multiple tasks.

### Magnetic Resonance Simulation of Effective Transverse Relaxation (T2*)
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19246v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19246v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19246v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19246v1)

2026/01/27 06:28 GTM

Purpose: To simulate effective transverse relaxation ($T_2^*$) as a part of MR simulation. $T_2^*$ consists of reversible ($T_2^{\prime}$) and irreversible ($T_2$) components. Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated.
  Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations.
  Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations. When the above-mentioned two techniques were utilized, the analytic solutions accelerated 19 times, and the combined transitions accelerated up to 17 times.
  Conclusion: Both theory and results showed that the proposed methods simulated $T_2^{\prime}$ efficiently by utilizing a linear model with a Lorentzian function, analytic solutions, and combined transitions.

### VC-Bench: Pioneering the Video Connecting Benchmark with a Dataset and Evaluation Metrics

While current video generation focuses on text or image conditions, practical applications like video editing and vlogging often need to seamlessly connect separate clips. In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity. We expect that VC-Bench will serve as a pioneering benchmark to inspire and guide future research in video connecting. The evaluation metrics and dataset are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VC-Bench-1B67/.

### Towards Pixel-Level VLM Perception via Simple Points Prediction

2026/01/27 05:50 GTM

We present SimpleSeg, a strikingly simple yet highly effective approach to endow Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with native pixel-level perception. Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/

### UniPCB: A Unified Vision-Language Benchmark for Open-Ended PCB Quality Inspection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19222v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19222v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19222v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19222v1)

2026/01/27 05:42 GTM

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for general industrial quality inspection, but fall short in complex scenarios, such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) inspection. PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research.

### Bridging Visual and Wireless Sensing: A Unified Radiation Field for 3D Radio Map Construction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19216v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19216v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19216v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19216v1)

The emerging applications of next-generation wireless networks (e.g., immersive 3D communication, low-altitude networks, and integrated sensing and communication) necessitate high-fidelity environmental intelligence. 3D radio maps have emerged as a critical tool for this purpose, enabling spectrum-aware planning and environment-aware sensing by bridging the gap between physical environments and electromagnetic signal propagation. However, constructing accurate 3D radio maps requires fine-grained 3D geometric information and a profound understanding of electromagnetic wave propagation. Existing approaches typically treat optical and wireless knowledge as distinct modalities, failing to exploit the fundamental physical principles governing both light and electromagnetic propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose URF-GS, a unified radio-optical radiation field representation framework for accurate and generalizable 3D radio map construction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) and inverse rendering. By fusing visual and wireless sensing observations, URF-GS recovers scene geometry and material properties while accurately predicting radio signal behavior at arbitrary transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that URF-GS achieves up to a 24.7% improvement in spatial spectrum prediction accuracy and a 10x increase in sample efficiency for 3D radio map construction compared with neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods. This work establishes a foundation for next-generation wireless networks by integrating perception, interaction, and communication through holistic radiation field reconstruction.

### Contrastive Spectral Rectification: Test-Time Defense towards Zero-shot Adversarial Robustness of CLIP
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19210v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19210v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19210v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19210v1)

2026/01/27 05:24 GTM

Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, yet remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Summu77/CSR.

### Evaluation of Oncotimia: An LLM based system for supporting tumour boards
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19899v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19899v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19899v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19899v1)

Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTBs) play a central role in oncology decision-making but require manual processes and structuring large volumes of heterogeneous clinical information, resulting in a substantial documentation burden. In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality.

Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.

### Reflective Translation: Improving Low-Resource Machine Translation via Structured Self-Reflection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19871v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19871v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19871v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19871v1)

Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings.

### Identifying and Transferring Reasoning-Critical Neurons: Improving LLM Inference Reliability via Activation Steering

Despite the strong reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on challenging tasks often requires post-training or computationally expensive sampling strategies, limiting their practical efficiency. In this work, we first show that a small subset of neurons in LLMs exhibits strong predictive correlations with reasoning correctness. Based on this observation, we propose AdaRAS (Adaptive Reasoning Activation Steering), a lightweight test-time framework that improves reasoning reliability by selectively intervening on neuron activations. AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25. Moreover, AdaRAS exhibits strong transferability across datasets and scalability to stronger models, outperforming post-training methods without additional training or sampling cost.

### Neural Neural Scaling Laws

Neural scaling laws predict how language model performance improves with increased compute. While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks. Our work suggests that predicting downstream scaling laws directly from data outperforms parametric alternatives.

### When Iterative RAG Beats Ideal Evidence: A Diagnostic Study in Scientific Multi-hop Question Answering
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19827v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19827v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19827v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19827v1)

2026/01/27 17:35 GTM

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.

### Zero-Shot Stance Detection in the Wild: Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19802v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19802v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19802v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19802v1)

Current stance detection research typically relies on predicting stance based on given targets and text. However, in real-world social media scenarios, targets are neither predefined nor static but rather complex and dynamic. To address this challenge, we propose a novel task: zero-shot stance detection in the wild with Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation (DGTA), which aims to automatically identify multiple target-stance pairs from text without prior target knowledge. We construct a Chinese social media stance detection dataset and design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. We explore both integrated and two-stage fine-tuning strategies for large language models (LLMs) and evaluate various baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance on this task: the two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B attains the highest comprehensive target recognition score of 66.99%, while the integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a stance detection F1 score of 79.26%.

### LVLMs and Humans Ground Differently in Referential Communication

For generative AI agents to partner effectively with human users, the ability to accurately predict human intent is critical. But this ability to collaborate remains limited by a critical deficit: an inability to model common ground. Here, we present a referential communication experiment with a factorial design involving director-matcher pairs (human-human, human-AI, AI-human, and AI-AI) that interact with multiple turns in repeated rounds to match pictures of objects not associated with any obvious lexicalized labels. We release the online pipeline for data collection, the tools and analyses for accuracy, efficiency, and lexical overlap, and a corpus of 356 dialogues (89 pairs over 4 rounds each) that unmasks LVLMs' limitations in interactively resolving referring expressions, a crucial skill that underlies human language use.

### Rethinking Discrete Speech Representation Tokens for Accent Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19786v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19786v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19786v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19786v1)

2026/01/27 16:48 GTM

Discrete Speech Representation Tokens (DSRTs) have become a foundational component in speech generation. While prior work has extensively studied phonetic and speaker information in DSRTs, how accent information is encoded in DSRTs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of accent information in DSRTs. We propose a unified evaluation framework that measures both accessibility of accent information via a novel Accent ABX task and recoverability via cross-accent Voice Conversion (VC) resynthesis. Using this framework, we analyse DSRTs derived from a variety of speech encoders. Our results reveal that accent information is substantially reduced when ASR supervision is used to fine-tune the encoder, but cannot be effectively disentangled from phonetic and speaker information through naive codebook size reduction. Based on these findings, we propose new content-only and content-accent DSRTs that significantly outperform existing designs in controllable accent generation. Our work highlights the importance of accent-aware evaluation and provides practical guidance for designing DSRTs for accent-controlled speech generation.

### Strong Reasoning Isn't Enough: Evaluating Evidence Elicitation in Interactive Diagnosis

Interactive medical consultation requires an agent to proactively elicit missing clinical evidence under uncertainty. Yet existing evaluations largely remain static or outcome-centric, neglecting the evidence-gathering process. In this work, we propose an interactive evaluation framework that explicitly models the consultation process using a simulated patient and a \rev{simulated reporter} grounded in atomic evidences. Based on this representation, we introduce Information Coverage Rate (ICR) to quantify how completely an agent uncovers necessary evidence during interaction. To support systematic study, we build EviMed, an evidence-based benchmark spanning diverse conditions from common complaints to rare diseases, and evaluate 10 models with varying reasoning abilities. We find that strong diagnostic reasoning does not guarantee effective information collection, and this insufficiency acts as a primary bottleneck limiting performance in interactive settings. To address this, we propose REFINE, a strategy that leverages diagnostic verification to guide the agent in proactively resolving uncertainties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms baselines across diverse datasets and facilitates effective model collaboration, enabling smaller agents to achieve superior performance under strong reasoning supervision. Our code can be found at https://github.com/NanshineLoong/EID-Benchmark .

### TokenSeek: Memory Efficient Fine Tuning via Instance-Aware Token Ditching
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19739v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19739v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19739v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19739v1)

Fine tuning has been regarded as a de facto approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but the high training memory consumption inherited from LLMs makes this process inefficient. Among existing memory efficient approaches, activation-related optimization has proven particularly effective, as activations consistently dominate overall memory consumption. Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

### RvB: Automating AI System Hardening via Iterative Red-Blue Games

2026/01/27 15:49 GTM

The dual offensive and defensive utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights a critical gap in AI security: the lack of unified frameworks for dynamic, iterative adversarial adaptation hardening. To bridge this gap, we propose the Red Team vs. Blue Team (RvB) framework, formulated as a training-free, sequential, imperfect-information game. In this process, the Red Team exposes vulnerabilities, driving the Blue Team to learning effective solutions without parameter updates. We validate our framework across two challenging domains: dynamic code hardening against CVEs and guardrail optimization against jailbreaks. Our empirical results show that this interaction compels the Blue Team to learn fundamental defensive principles, leading to robust remediations that are not merely overfitted to specific exploits. RvB achieves Defense Success Rates of 90\% and 45\% across the respective tasks while maintaining near 0\% False Positive Rates, significantly surpassing baselines. This work establishes the iterative adversarial interaction framework as a practical paradigm that automates the continuous hardening of AI systems.

### Component-Level Lesioning of Language Models Reveals Clinically Aligned Aphasia Phenotypes
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19723v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19723v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19723v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19723v1)

Large language models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit human-like linguistic behaviors and internal representations that they could serve as computational simulators of language cognition. We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions.

### SynCABEL: Synthetic Contextualized Augmentation for Biomedical Entity Linking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19667v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19667v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19667v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19667v1)

2026/01/27 14:47 GTM

We present SynCABEL (Synthetic Contextualized Augmentation for Biomedical Entity Linking), a framework that addresses a central bottleneck in supervised biomedical entity linking (BEL): the scarcity of expert-annotated training data. SynCABEL leverages large language models to generate context-rich synthetic training examples for all candidate concepts in a target knowledge base, providing broad supervision without manual annotation. We demonstrate that SynCABEL, when combined with decoder-only models and guided inference establish new state-of-the-art results across three widely used multilingual benchmarks: MedMentions for English, QUAERO for French, and SPACCC for Spanish. Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling. Finally, acknowledging that standard evaluation based on exact code matching often underestimates clinically valid predictions due to ontology redundancy, we introduce an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. This analysis reveals that SynCABEL significantly improves the rate of clinically valid predictions. Our synthetic datasets, models, and code are released to support reproducibility and future research.

### One Token Is Enough: Improving Diffusion Language Models with a Sink Token
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19657v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19657v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19657v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19657v1)

2026/01/27 14:32 GTM

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive approaches, enabling parallel text generation with competitive performance. Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink.

### RATE: Reviewer Profiling and Annotation-free Training for Expertise Ranking in Peer Review Systems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19637v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19637v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19637v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19637v1)

2026/01/27 14:13 GTM

Reviewer assignment is increasingly critical yet challenging in the LLM era, where rapid topic shifts render many pre-2023 benchmarks outdated and where proxy signals poorly reflect true reviewer familiarity. We address this evaluation bottleneck by introducing LR-bench, a high-fidelity, up-to-date benchmark curated from 2024-2025 AI/NLP manuscripts with five-level self-assessed familiarity ratings collected via a large-scale email survey, yielding 1055 expert-annotated paper-reviewer-score annotations. We further propose RATE, a reviewer-centric ranking framework that distills each reviewer's recent publications into compact keyword-based profiles and fine-tunes an embedding model with weak preference supervision constructed from heuristic retrieval signals, enabling matching each manuscript against a reviewer profile directly. Across LR-bench and the CMU gold-standard dataset, our approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong embedding baselines by a clear margin. We release LR-bench at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gnociew/LR-bench, and a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Gnociew/RATE-Reviewer-Assign.

### Up to 36x Speedup: Mask-based Parallel Inference Paradigm for Key Information Extraction in MLLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19613v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19613v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19613v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19613v1)

Key Information Extraction (KIE) from visually-rich documents (VrDs) is a critical task, for which recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong potential. However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using "[mask]" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions.

### Explicit Multi-head Attention for Inter-head Interaction in Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19611v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19611v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19611v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19611v1)

2026/01/27 13:45 GTM

In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

### Decompose-and-Formalise: Recursively Verifiable Natural Language Inference
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19605v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19605v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19605v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19605v1)

Recent work has shown that integrating large language models (LLMs) with theorem provers (TPs) in neuro-symbolic pipelines helps with entailment verification and proof-guided refinement of explanations for natural language inference (NLI). However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $θ$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy.

Deep research has emerged as a transformative capability for autonomous agents, empowering Large Language Models to navigate complex, open-ended tasks. However, realizing its full potential is hindered by critical limitations, including escalating contextual noise in long-horizon tasks, fragility leading to cascading errors, and a lack of modular extensibility. To address these challenges, we introduce Yunque DeepResearch, a hierarchical, modular, and robust framework. The architecture is characterized by three key components: (1) a centralized Multi-Agent Orchestration System that routes subtasks to an Atomic Capability Pool of tools and specialized sub-agents; (2) a Dynamic Context Management mechanism that structures completed sub-goals into semantic summaries to mitigate information overload; and (3) a proactive Supervisor Module that ensures resilience through active anomaly detection and context pruning. Yunque DeepResearch achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of agentic deep research benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp, BrowseComp-ZH, and Humanity's Last Exam. We open-source the framework, reproducible implementations, and application cases to empower the community.

### Benchmarks Saturate When The Model Gets Smarter Than The Judge
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19532v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19532v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19532v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19532v1)

2026/01/27 12:20 GTM

Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

### Enhancing Academic Paper Recommendations Using Fine-Grained Knowledge Entities and Multifaceted Document Embeddings
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19513v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19513v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19513v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19513v1)

In the era of explosive growth in academic literature, the burden of literature review on scholars are increasing. Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors. The proposed recommendation method was evaluated using the STM-KG dataset, a knowledge graph that incorporates scientific concepts derived from papers across ten distinct domains. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving an average precision of 27.3% among the top 50 recommendations. This represents an improvement of 6.7% over existing approaches.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently empowered agentic frameworks to exhibit advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution. Results reveal Claude-4.1-Opus as the top closed-source model and Falcon-H1-7B as the top open-source model under CaP.

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in cross-modal tasks but face significant safety challenges, which undermine their reliability in real-world applications. Efforts have been made to build LVLM safety evaluation benchmarks to uncover their vulnerability. However, existing benchmarks are hindered by their labor-intensive construction process, static complexity, and limited discriminative power. Thus, they may fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving models and emerging risks. To address these limitations, we propose VLSafetyBencher, the first automated system for LVLM safety benchmarking. VLSafetyBencher introduces four collaborative agents: Data Preprocessing, Generation, Augmentation, and Selection agents to construct and select high-quality samples. Experiments validates that VLSafetyBencher can construct high-quality safety benchmarks within one week at a minimal cost. The generated benchmark effectively distinguish safety, with a safety rate disparity of 70% between the most and least safe models.

### GradPruner: Gradient-Guided Layer Pruning Enabling Efficient Fine-Tuning and Inference for LLMs

Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with downstream data is often considered time-consuming and expensive. Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available.

Fact-checking remains a demanding and time-consuming task, still largely dependent on manual verification and unable to match the rapid spread of misinformation online. This is particularly important because debunking false information typically takes longer to reach consumers than the misinformation itself; accelerating corrections through automation can therefore help counter it more effectively. Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content. These limitations have motivated interest in automating fact-checking, where identifying claims is a crucial first step. However, progress has been uneven across languages, with English dominating due to abundant annotated data. Portuguese, like other languages, still lacks accessible, licensed datasets, limiting research, NLP developments and applications. In this paper, we introduce ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, comprising 1,308 articles and 6,875 individual annotations. Unlike most existing resources based on social media or parliamentary transcripts, ClaimPT focuses on journalistic content, collected through a partnership with LUSA, the Portuguese News Agency. To ensure annotation quality, two trained annotators labeled each article, with a curator validating all annotations according to a newly proposed scheme. We also provide baseline models for claim detection, establishing initial benchmarks and enabling future NLP and IR applications. By releasing ClaimPT, we aim to advance research on low-resource fact-checking and enhance understanding of misinformation in news media.

### Dynamic Multi-Expert Projectors with Stabilized Routing for Multilingual Speech Recognition

Recent advances in LLM-based ASR connect frozen speech encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) via lightweight projectors. While effective in monolingual settings, a single projector struggles to capture the diverse acoustic-to-semantic mappings required for multilingual ASR. To address this, we propose SMEAR-MoE, a stabilized Mixture-of-Experts projector that ensures dense gradient flow to all experts, preventing expert collapse while enabling cross-lingual sharing. We systematically compare monolithic, static multi-projector, and dynamic MoE designs across four Indic languages (Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu). Our SMEAR-MoE achieves strong performance, delivering upto a 7.6% relative WER reduction over the single-projector baseline, while maintaining comparable runtime efficiency. Analysis of expert routing further shows linguistically meaningful specialization, with related languages sharing experts. These results demonstrate that stable multi-expert projectors are key to scalable and robust multilingual ASR.

### KG-CRAFT: Knowledge Graph-based Contrastive Reasoning with LLMs for Enhancing Automated Fact-checking

Claim verification is a core component of automated fact-checking systems, aimed at determining the truthfulness of a statement by assessing it against reliable evidence sources such as documents or knowledge bases. This work presents KG-CRAFT, a method that improves automatic claim verification by leveraging large language models (LLMs) augmented with contrastive questions grounded in a knowledge graph. KG-CRAFT first constructs a knowledge graph from claims and associated reports, then formulates contextually relevant contrastive questions based on the knowledge graph structure. These questions guide the distillation of evidence-based reports, which are synthesised into a concise summary that is used for veracity assessment by LLMs. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets (LIAR-RAW and RAWFC) demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in predictive performance. Comprehensive analyses validate in detail the effectiveness of our knowledge graph-based contrastive reasoning approach in improving LLMs' fact-checking capabilities.

### Ad Insertion in LLM-Generated Responses

Sustainable monetization of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical open challenge. Traditional search advertising, which relies on static keywords, fails to capture the fleeting, context-dependent user intents--the specific information, goods, or services a user seeks--embedded in conversational flows. Beyond the standard goal of social welfare maximization, effective LLM advertising imposes additional requirements on contextual coherence (ensuring ads align semantically with transient user intents) and computational efficiency (avoiding user interaction latency), as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, including preserving privacy and ensuring explicit ad disclosure. Although various recent solutions have explored bidding on token-level and query-level, both categories of approaches generally fail to holistically satisfy this multifaceted set of constraints.
  We propose a practical framework that resolves these tensions through two decoupling strategies. First, we decouple ad insertion from response generation to ensure safety and explicit disclosure. Second, we decouple bidding from specific user queries by using ``genres'' (high-level semantic clusters) as a proxy. This allows advertisers to bid on stable categories rather than sensitive real-time response, reducing computational burden and privacy risks. We demonstrate that applying the VCG auction mechanism to this genre-based framework yields approximately dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR), as well as approximately optimal social welfare, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Finally, we introduce an "LLM-as-a-Judge" metric to estimate contextual coherence. Our experiments show that this metric correlates strongly with human ratings (Spearman's $ρ\approx 0.66$), outperforming 80% of individual human evaluators.

### Do LLMs Truly Benefit from Longer Context in Automatic Post-Editing?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19410v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19410v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19410v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19410v1)

Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to refine machine translations by correcting residual errors. Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.
  Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement.

### Binary Token-Level Classification with DeBERTa for All-Type MWE Identification: A Lightweight Approach with Linguistic Enhancement
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19360v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19360v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19360v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19360v1)

2026/01/27 08:42 GTM

We present a comprehensive approach for multiword expression (MWE) identification that combines binary token-level classification, linguistic feature integration, and data augmentation. Our DeBERTa-v3-large model achieves 69.8% F1 on the CoAM dataset, surpassing the best results (Qwen-72B, 57.8% F1) on this dataset by 12 points while using 165x fewer parameters. We achieve this performance by (1) reformulating detection as binary token-level START/END/INSIDE classification rather than span-based prediction, (2) incorporating NP chunking and dependency features that help discontinuous and NOUN-type MWEs identification, and (3) applying oversampling that addresses severe class imbalance in the training data. We confirm the generalization of our method on the STREUSLE dataset, achieving 78.9% F1. These results demonstrate that carefully designed smaller models can substantially outperform LLMs on structured NLP tasks, with important implications for resource-constrained deployments.

### Cross-Examination Framework: A Task-Agnostic Diagnostic for Information Fidelity in Text-to-Text Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19350v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19350v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19350v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19350v1)

2026/01/27 08:30 GTM

Traditional metrics like BLEU and BERTScore fail to capture semantic fidelity in generative text-to-text tasks. We adapt the Cross-Examination Framework (CEF) for a reference-free, multi-dimensional evaluation by treating the source and candidate as independent knowledge bases. CEF generates verifiable questions from each text and performs a cross-examination to derive three interpretable scores: Coverage, Conformity, and Consistency. Validated across translation, summarization and clinical note-generation, our framework identifies critical errors, such as content omissions and factual contradictions, missed by standard metrics. A key contribution is a systematic robustness analysis to select a stable judge model. Crucially, the strong correlation between our reference-free and with-reference modes validates CEF's reliability without gold references. Furthermore, human expert validation demonstrates that CEF mismatching questions align with meaning-altering semantic errors higher than with non-semantic errors, particularly excelling at identifying entity-based and relational distortions.

### When Benchmarks Leak: Inference-Time Decontamination for LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19334v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19334v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19334v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19334v1)

Benchmark-based evaluation is the de facto standard for comparing large language models (LLMs). However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility.

### Formula-One Prompting: Adaptive Reasoning Through Equations For Applied Mathematics
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19302v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19302v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19302v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19302v1)

Prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-of-Thought (PoT) improve LLM mathematical reasoning by structuring intermediate steps in natural language or code. However, applied mathematics problems in domains like finance, physics, and cryptography often require recalling or deriving governing equations, a step that current approaches do not explicitly leverage. We propose Formula-One Prompting (F-1), a two-phase approach that uses mathematical equations as an intermediate representation before adaptive solving. F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average. Crucially, gains are largest in applied domains: +13.30% on FinanceMath over CoT, and within OlympiadBench, larger gains on physics (+2.55%) than pure math (+0.44%). This demonstrates that F-1 is more effective than CoT in applied mathematics problems.

### MetaGen: Self-Evolving Roles and Topologies for Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19290v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19290v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19290v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19290v1)

Large language models are increasingly deployed as multi-agent systems, where specialized roles communicate and collaborate through structured interactions to solve complex tasks that often exceed the capacity of a single agent. However, most existing systems still rely on a fixed role library and an execution-frozen interaction topology, a rigid design choice that frequently leads to task mismatch, prevents timely adaptation when new evidence emerges during reasoning, and further inflates inference cost. We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights. MetaGen generates and rewrites query-conditioned role specifications to maintain a controllable dynamic role pool, then instantiates a constrained execution graph around a minimal backbone. During execution, it iteratively updates role prompts and adjusts structural decisions using lightweight feedback signals. Experiments on code generation and multi-step reasoning benchmarks show that MetaGen improves the accuracy and cost tradeoff over strong multi-agent baselines.

### ReToP: Learning to Rewrite Electronic Health Records for Clinical Prediction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19286v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19286v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19286v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19286v1)

2026/01/27 07:20 GTM

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide crucial information for clinical decision-making. However, their high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity make clinical prediction challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction. Our ReToP framework surpasses strong baseline models across three clinical tasks on MIMIC-IV. Moreover, the analysis of ReToP shows its generalizability to unseen datasets and tasks with minimal fine-tuning while preserving faithful rewrites and emphasizing task-relevant predictive features.

### Group Distributionally Robust Optimization-Driven Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19280v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19280v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19280v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19280v1)

2026/01/27 07:10 GTM

Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.
  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance.

### DART: Diffusion-Inspired Speculative Decoding for Fast LLM Inference
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19278v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19278v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19278v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19278v1)

2026/01/27 07:04 GTM

Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless approach for accelerating LLM inference. However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework. Code is released at https://github.com/fvliang/DART.

### Riddle Quest : The Enigma of Words

Riddles are concise linguistic puzzles that describe an object or idea through indirect, figurative, or playful clues. They are a longstanding form of creative expression, requiring the solver to interpret hints, recognize patterns, and draw inferences to identify the answers. In this work, we introduce a simple pipeline for creating and evaluating analogy-based riddles. The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types. Our case study shows that while models often guess the main intended answer, they frequently miss other valid interpretations. This highlights the value of riddles as a lightweight tool for examining reasoning coverage and ambiguity handling in language models.

### DiaDem: Advancing Dialogue Descriptions in Audiovisual Video Captioning for Multimodal Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19267v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19267v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19267v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19267v1)

2026/01/27 06:55 GTM

Accurate dialogue description in audiovisual video captioning is crucial for downstream understanding and generation tasks. However, existing models generally struggle to produce faithful dialogue descriptions within audiovisual captions. To mitigate this limitation, we propose DiaDem, a powerful audiovisual video captioning model capable of generating captions with more precise dialogue descriptions while maintaining strong overall performance. We first synthesize a high-quality dataset for SFT, then employ a difficulty-partitioned two-stage GRPO strategy to further enhance dialogue descriptions. To enable systematic evaluation of dialogue description capabilities, we introduce DiaDemBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate models across diverse dialogue scenarios, emphasizing both speaker attribution accuracy and utterance transcription fidelity in audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments on DiaDemBench reveal even commercial models still exhibit substantial room for improvement in dialogue-aware captioning. Notably, DiaDem not only outperforms the Gemini series in dialogue description accuracy but also achieves competitive performance on general audiovisual captioning benchmarks, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

### RPO-RAG: Aligning Small LLMs with Relation-aware Preference Optimization for Knowledge Graph Question Answering
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19225v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19225v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19225v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19225v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.

### DREAMSTATE: Diffusing States and Parameters for Recurrent Large Language Models

Modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as RWKV, are distinguished by their powerful short-range modeling capabilities and efficient fixed-size states, which constitute a core advantage over standard Transformers. However, there is a significant lack of research into their internal state as an editable knowledge representation. To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility. Our work not only opens a new research direction for RNN state representation but also provides a concrete architectural reference for future model design. The code is publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/2dgx41s/DreamState.

Extracting actionable suggestions from customer reviews is essential for operational decision-making, yet these directives are often embedded within mixed-intent, unstructured text. Existing approaches either classify suggestion-bearing sentences or generate high-level summaries, but rarely isolate the precise improvement instructions businesses need. We evaluate a hybrid pipeline combining a high-recall RoBERTa classifier trained with a precision-recall surrogate to reduce unrecoverable false negatives with a controlled, instruction-tuned LLM for suggestion extraction, categorization, clustering, and summarization. Across real-world hospitality and food datasets, the hybrid system outperforms prompt-only, rule-based, and classifier-only baselines in extraction accuracy and cluster coherence. Human evaluations further confirm that the resulting suggestions and summaries are clear, faithful, and interpretable. Overall, our results show that hybrid reasoning architectures achieve meaningful improvements fine-grained actionable suggestion mining while highlighting challenges in domain adaptation and efficient local deployment.

Semantic associations such as the link between "bird" and "flew" are foundational for language modeling as they enable models to go beyond memorization and instead generalize and generate coherent text. Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions. Experiments on real-world LLMs demonstrate that our theoretical weight characterizations closely match the learned weights, and qualitative analyses further show how our theorem shines light on interpreting the learned associations in transformers.

### VGGT-SLAM 2.0: Real time Dense Feed-forward Scene Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19887v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19887v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19887v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19887v1)

We present VGGT-SLAM 2.0, a real time RGB feed-forward SLAM system which substantially improves upon VGGT-SLAM for incrementally aligning submaps created from VGGT. Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.

### Estimating Trust in Human-Robot Collaboration through Behavioral Indicators and Explainability
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19856v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19856v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19856v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19856v1)

Industry 5.0 focuses on human-centric collaboration between humans and robots, prioritizing safety, comfort, and trust. This study introduces a data-driven framework to assess trust using behavioral indicators. The framework employs a Preference-Based Optimization algorithm to generate trust-enhancing trajectories based on operator feedback. This feedback serves as ground truth for training machine learning models to predict trust levels from behavioral indicators. The framework was tested in a chemical industry scenario where a robot assisted a human operator in mixing chemicals. Machine learning models classified trust with over 80\% accuracy, with the Voting Classifier achieving 84.07\% accuracy and an AUC-ROC score of 0.90. These findings underscore the effectiveness of data-driven methods in assessing trust within human-robot collaboration, emphasizing the valuable role behavioral indicators play in predicting the dynamics of human trust.

### How Does Delegation in Social Interaction Evolve Over Time? Navigation with a Robot for Blind People
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19851v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19851v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19851v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19851v1)

Autonomy and independent navigation are vital to daily life but remain challenging for individuals with blindness. Robotic systems can enhance mobility and confidence by providing intelligent navigation assistance. However, fully autonomous systems may reduce users' sense of control, even when they wish to remain actively involved. Although collaboration between user and robot has been recognized as important, little is known about how perceptions of this relationship change with repeated use. We present a repeated exposure study with six blind participants who interacted with a navigation-assistive robot in a real-world museum. Participants completed tasks such as navigating crowds, approaching lines, and encountering obstacles. Findings show that participants refined their strategies over time, developing clearer preferences about when to rely on the robot versus act independently. This work provides insights into how strategies and preferences evolve with repeated interaction and offers design implications for robots that adapt to user needs over time.

### HARMONI: Multimodal Personalization of Multi-User Human-Robot Interactions with LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19839v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19839v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19839v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19839v1)

2026/01/27 17:45 GTM

Existing human-robot interaction systems often lack mechanisms for sustained personalization and dynamic adaptation in multi-user environments, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. We present HARMONI, a multimodal personalization framework that leverages large language models to enable socially assistive robots to manage long-term multi-user interactions. The framework integrates four key modules: (i) a perception module that identifies active speakers and extracts multimodal input; (ii) a world modeling module that maintains representations of the environment and short-term conversational context; (iii) a user modeling module that updates long-term speaker-specific profiles; and (iv) a generation module that produces contextually grounded and ethically informed responses. Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.

### Information-Theoretic Detection of Bimanual Interactions for Dual-Arm Robot Plan Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19832v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19832v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19832v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19832v1)

Programming by demonstration is a strategy to simplify the robot programming process for non-experts via human demonstrations. However, its adoption for bimanual tasks is an underexplored problem due to the complexity of hand coordination, which also hinders data recording. This paper presents a novel one-shot method for processing a single RGB video of a bimanual task demonstration to generate an execution plan for a dual-arm robotic system. To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination. We validated the effectiveness of this framework through multiple subject video demonstrations, which we collected and made open-source, and exploiting data from an external, publicly available dataset. Comparisons with existing methods revealed significant improvements in generating a centralized execution plan for coordinating two-arm systems.

### Whether We Care, How We Reason: The Dual Role of Anthropomorphism and Moral Foundations in Robot Abuse
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19826v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19826v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19826v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19826v1)

2026/01/27 17:34 GTM

As robots become increasingly integrated into daily life, understanding responses to robot mistreatment carries important ethical and design implications. This mixed-methods study (N = 201) examined how anthropomorphic levels and moral foundations shape reactions to robot abuse. Participants viewed videos depicting physical mistreatment of robots varying in humanness (Spider, Twofoot, Humanoid) and completed measures assessing moral foundations, anger, and social distance. Results revealed that anthropomorphism determines whether people extend moral consideration to robots, while moral foundations shape how they reason about such consideration. Qualitative analysis revealed distinct reasoning patterns: low-progressivism individuals employed character-based judgments, while high-progressivism individuals engaged in future-oriented moral deliberation. Findings offer implications for robot design and policy communication.

### Unsupervised Learning of Efficient Exploration: Pre-training Adaptive Policies via Self-Imposed Goals
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19810v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19810v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19810v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19810v1)

Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.

### Reimagining Social Robots as Recommender Systems: Foundations, Framework, and Applications
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19761v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19761v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19761v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19761v1)

Personalization in social robots refers to the ability of the robot to meet the needs and/or preferences of an individual user. Existing approaches typically rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses based on user metadata and historical interactions or on adaptive methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) to learn from users' immediate reactions in real time. However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. To ensure the integration of RS techniques is well-grounded and seamless throughout the social robot pipeline, we (i) align the paradigms underlying social robots and RSs, (ii) identify key techniques that can enhance personalization in social robots, and (iii) design them as modular, plug-and-play components. This work not only establishes a framework for integrating RS techniques into social robots but also opens a pathway for deep collaboration between the RS and HRI communities, accelerating innovation in both fields.

### SCOPE: Smooth Convex Optimization for Planned Evolution of Deformable Linear Objects
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19742v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19742v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19742v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19742v1)

2026/01/27 16:01 GTM

We present SCOPE, a fast and efficient framework for modeling and manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs). Unlike conventional energy-based approaches, SCOPE leverages convex approximations to significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining smooth and physically plausible deformations. This trade-off between speed and accuracy makes the method particularly suitable for applications requiring real-time or near-real-time response. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation experiments, highlighting its ability to generate smooth shape trajectories under geometric and length constraints.

### Scalable Exploration for High-Dimensional Continuous Control via Value-Guided Flow
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19707v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19707v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19707v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19707v1)

Controlling high-dimensional systems in biological and robotic applications is challenging due to expansive state-action spaces, where effective exploration is critical. Commonly used exploration strategies in reinforcement learning are largely undirected with sharp degradation as action dimensionality grows. Many existing methods resort to dimensionality reduction, which constrains policy expressiveness and forfeits system flexibility. We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise. Our proposed method substantially outperforms representative online reinforcement learning baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks. Qflex also successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model to perform agile, complex movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency in very high-dimensional settings. Our results indicate that value-guided flows offer a principled and practical route to exploration at scale.

### Enhancing Worker Safety in Harbors Using Quadruped Robots

Infrastructure inspection is becoming increasingly relevant in the field of robotics due to its significant impact on ensuring workers' safety. The harbor environment presents various challenges in designing a robotic solution for inspection, given the complexity of daily operations. This work introduces an initial phase to identify critical areas within the port environment. Following this, a preliminary solution using a quadruped robot for inspecting these critical areas is analyzed.

### AC^2-VLA: Action-Context-Aware Adaptive Computation in Vision-Language-Action Models for Efficient Robotic Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19634v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19634v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19634v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19634v1)

2026/01/27 14:10 GTM

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance in robotic manipulation, yet their closed-loop deployment is hindered by the high latency and compute cost of repeatedly running large vision-language backbones at every timestep. We observe that VLA inference exhibits structured redundancies across temporal, spatial, and depth dimensions, and that most existing efficiency methods ignore action context, despite its central role in embodied tasks. To address this gap, we propose Action-Context-aware Adaptive Computation for VLA models (AC^2-VLA), a unified framework that conditions computation on current visual observations, language instructions, and previous action states. Based on this action-centric context, AC^2-VLA adaptively performs cognition reuse across timesteps, token pruning, and selective execution of model components within a unified mechanism. To train the adaptive policy, we introduce an action-guided self-distillation scheme that preserves the behavior of the dense VLA policy while enabling structured sparsification that transfers across tasks and settings. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that AC^2-VLA achieves up to a 1.79\times speedup while reducing FLOPs to 29.4% of the dense baseline, with comparable task success.

### Safe Exploration via Policy Priors
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19612v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19612v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19612v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19612v1)

2026/01/27 13:45 GTM

Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.

### The S3LI Vulcano Dataset: A Dataset for Multi-Modal SLAM in Unstructured Planetary Environments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19557v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19557v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19557v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19557v1)

2026/01/27 12:49 GTM

We release the S3LI Vulcano dataset, a multi-modal dataset towards development and benchmarking of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and place recognition algorithms that rely on visual and LiDAR modalities. Several sequences are recorded on the volcanic island of Vulcano, from the Aeolian Islands in Sicily, Italy. The sequences provide users with data from a variety of environments, textures and terrains, including basaltic or iron-rich rocks, geological formations from old lava channels, as well as dry vegetation and water. The data (rmc.dlr.de/s3li_dataset) is accompanied by an open source toolkit (github.com/DLR-RM/s3li-toolkit) providing tools for generating ground truth poses as well as preparation of labelled samples for place recognition tasks.

### Enhancing Inverse Perspective Mapping for Automatic Vectorized Road Map Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19536v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19536v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19536v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19536v1)

2026/01/27 12:27 GTM

In this study, we present a low-cost and unified framework for vectorized road mapping leveraging enhanced inverse perspective mapping (IPM). In this framework, Catmull-Rom splines are utilized to characterize lane lines, and all the other ground markings are depicted using polygons uniformly. The results from instance segmentation serve as references to refine the three-dimensional position of spline control points and polygon corner points. In conjunction with this process, the homography matrix of IPM and vehicle poses are optimized simultaneously. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the mapping errors associated with IPM. It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM. These enhancements enable IPM to be effectively applied to vectorized road mapping, which serves a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy. In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines. The proposed framework is evaluated in two different practical scenarios, and the test results show that our method can automatically generate high-precision maps with near-centimeter-level accuracy. Importantly, the optimized IPM matrix achieves an accuracy comparable to that of manual calibration, while the accuracy of vehicle poses is also significantly improved.

### Rhombot: Rhombus-shaped Modular Robots for Stable, Medium-Independent Reconfiguration Motion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19529v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19529v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19529v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19529v1)

2026/01/27 12:15 GTM

In this paper, we present Rhombot, a novel deformable planar lattice modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSRR) with a rhombus shaped module. Each module consists of a parallelogram skeleton with a single centrally mounted actuator that enables folding and unfolding along its diagonal. The core design philosophy is to achieve essential MSRR functionalities such as morphing, docking, and locomotion with minimal control complexity. This enables a continuous and stable reconfiguration process that is independent of the surrounding medium, allowing the system to reliably form various configurations in diverse environments. To leverage the unique kinematics of Rhombot, we introduce morphpivoting, a novel motion primitive for reconfiguration that differs from advanced MSRR systems, and propose a strategy for its continuous execution. Finally, a series of physical experiments validate the module's stable reconfiguration ability, as well as its positional and docking accuracy.

### PALM: Enhanced Generalizability for Local Visuomotor Policies via Perception Alignment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19514v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19514v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19514v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19514v1)

2026/01/27 11:55 GTM

Generalizing beyond the training domain in image-based behavior cloning remains challenging. Existing methods address individual axes of generalization, workspace shifts, viewpoint changes, and cross-embodiment transfer, yet they are typically developed in isolation and often rely on complex pipelines. We introduce PALM (Perception Alignment for Local Manipulation), which leverages the invariance of local action distributions between out-of-distribution (OOD) and demonstrated domains to address these OOD shifts concurrently, without additional input modalities, model changes, or data collection. PALM modularizes the manipulation policy into coarse global components and a local policy for fine-grained actions. We reduce the discrepancy between in-domain and OOD inputs at the local policy level by enforcing local visual focus and consistent proprioceptive representation, allowing the policy to retrieve invariant local actions under OOD conditions. Experiments show that PALM limits OOD performance drops to 8% in simulation and 24% in the real world, compared to 45% and 77% for baselines.

### ALRM: Agentic LLM for Robotic Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19510v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19510v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19510v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19510v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently empowered agentic frameworks to exhibit advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution. Results reveal Claude-4.1-Opus as the top closed-source model and Falcon-H1-7B as the top open-source model under CaP.

### A DVL Aided Loosely Coupled Inertial Navigation Strategy for AUVs with Attitude Error Modeling and Variance Propagation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19509v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19509v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19509v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19509v1)

In underwater navigation systems, strap-down inertial navigation system/Doppler velocity log (SINS/DVL)-based loosely coupled architectures are widely adopted. Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.

### Reinforcement Learning Goal-Reaching Control with Guaranteed Lyapunov-Like Stabilizer for Mobile Robots
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19499v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19499v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19499v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19499v1)

Reinforcement learning (RL) can be highly effective at learning goal-reaching policies, but it typically does not provide formal guarantees that the goal will always be reached. A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency.

### Self-Reconfiguration Planning for Deformable Quadrilateral Modular Robots
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19496v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.19496v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19496v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.19496v1)

For lattice modular self-reconfigurable robots (MSRRs), maintaining stable connections during reconfiguration is crucial for physical feasibility and deployability. This letter presents a novel self-reconfiguration planning algorithm for deformable quadrilateral MSRRs that guarantees stable connection. The method first constructs feasible connect/disconnect actions using a virtual graph representation, and then organizes these actions into a valid execution sequence through a Dependence-based Reverse Tree (DRTree) that resolves interdependencies. We also prove that reconfiguration sequences satisfying motion characteristics exist for any pair of configurations with seven or more modules (excluding linear topologies). Finally, comparisons with a modified BiRRT algorithm highlight the superior efficiency and stability of our approach, while deployment on a physical robotic platform confirms its practical feasibility.

This paper aims to provide a clear and rigorous understanding of commonly recognized safety constraints in physical human-robot interaction, i.e. ISO/TS 15066, by examining how they are obtained and which assumptions support them. We clarify the interpretation and practical impact of key simplifying assumptions, show how these modeling choices affect both safety and performance across the system, and indicate specific design parameters that can be adjusted in safety-critical control implementations. Numerical examples are provided to quantify performance degradation induced by common approximations and simplifying design choices. Furthermore, the fundamental role of energy in safety assessment is emphasized, and focused insights are offered on the existing body of work concerning energy-based safety methodologies.

Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.

### Task-Centric Policy Optimization from Misaligned Motion Priors

Humanoid control often leverages motion priors from human demonstrations to encourage natural behaviors. However, such demonstrations are frequently suboptimal or misaligned with robotic tasks due to embodiment differences, retargeting errors, and task-irrelevant variations, causing naïve imitation to degrade task performance. Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment. We provide theoretical analysis of gradient conflict and task-priority stationary points, and validate our claims through humanoid control experiments demonstrating robust task performance with consistent motion style under noisy demonstrations.

Synthetic simulation data and real-world human data provide scalable alternatives to circumvent the prohibitive costs of robot data collection. However, these sources suffer from the sim-to-real visual gap and the human-to-robot embodiment gap, respectively, which limits the policy's generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we identify a natural yet underexplored complementarity between these sources: simulation offers the robot action that human data lacks, while human data provides the real-world observation that simulation struggles to render. Motivated by this insight, we present SimHum, a co-training framework to simultaneously extract kinematic prior from simulated robot actions and visual prior from real-world human observations. Based on the two complementary priors, we achieve data-efficient and generalizable robotic manipulation in real-world tasks. Empirically, SimHum outperforms the baseline by up to $\mathbf{40\%}$ under the same data collection budget, and achieves a $\mathbf{62.5\%}$ OOD success with only 80 real data, outperforming the real only baseline by $7.1\times$.

### Judgelight: Trajectory-Level Post-Optimization for Multi-Agent Path Finding via Closed-Subwalk Collapsing

Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is an NP-hard problem with applications in warehouse automation and multi-robot coordination. Learning-based MAPF solvers offer fast and scalable planning but often produce feasible trajectories that contain unnecessary or oscillatory movements. We propose Judgelight, a post-optimization method that improves trajectory quality after a MAPF solver generates a feasible schedule. Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experimental results show Judgelight consistently reduces solution cost by around 20%, particularly for learning-based solvers, producing trajectories that are better suited for real-world deployment.

This paper presents the web-based platform Machine Learning with Bricks and an accompanying two-day course designed to teach machine learning concepts to students aged 12 to 17 through programming-free robotics activities. Machine Learning with Bricks is an open source platform and combines interactive visualizations with LEGO robotics to teach three core algorithms: KNN, linear regression, and Q-learning. Students learn by collecting data, training models, and interacting with robots via a web-based interface. Pre- and post-surveys with 14 students demonstrate significant improvements in conceptual understanding of machine learning algorithms, positive shifts in AI perception, high platform usability, and increased motivation for continued learning. This work demonstrates that tangible, visualization-based approaches can make machine learning concepts accessible and engaging for young learners while maintaining technical depth.

Deploying deep learning agents for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments faces critical challenges regarding safety, data scarcity, and limited computational resources. Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

### Perception-to-Pursuit: Track-Centric Temporal Reasoning for Open-World Drone Detection and Autonomous Chasing

Autonomous drone pursuit requires not only detecting drones but also predicting their trajectories in a manner that enables kinematically feasible interception. Existing tracking methods optimize for prediction accuracy but ignore pursuit feasibility, resulting in trajectories that are physically impossible to intercept 99.9% of the time. We propose Perception-to-Pursuit (P2P), a track-centric temporal reasoning framework that bridges detection and actionable pursuit planning. Our method represents drone motion as compact 8-dimensional tokens capturing velocity, acceleration, scale, and smoothness, enabling a 12-frame causal transformer to reason about future behavior. We introduce the Intercept Success Rate (ISR) metric to measure pursuit feasibility under realistic interceptor constraints. Evaluated on the Anti-UAV-RGBT dataset with 226 real drone sequences, P2P achieves 28.12 pixel average displacement error and 0.597 ISR, representing a 77% improvement in trajectory prediction and 597x improvement in pursuit feasibility over tracking-only baselines, while maintaining perfect drone classification accuracy (100%). Our work demonstrates that temporal reasoning over motion patterns enables both accurate prediction and actionable pursuit planning.

### Tactile Memory with Soft Robot: Robust Object Insertion via Masked Encoding and Soft Wrist

Tactile memory, the ability to store and retrieve touch-based experience, is critical for contact-rich tasks such as key insertion under uncertainty. To replicate this capability, we introduce Tactile Memory with Soft Robot (TaMeSo-bot), a system that integrates a soft wrist with tactile retrieval-based control to enable safe and robust manipulation. The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation. We validate our approach on peg-in-hole tasks with diverse pegs and conditions in real-robot experiments. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that MAT$^\text{3}$ achieves higher success rates than the baselines over all conditions and shows remarkable capability to adapt to unseen pegs and conditions.

As nuclear facilities experience digital transformation and advanced reactor development, AI integration, cyber-physical security, and other emerging technologies such as autonomous robot operations are increasingly developed. However, evaluation and deployment is challenged by the lack of dedicated virtual testbeds. The Immersive Framework for Advanced Nuclear (iFAN) ecosystem is developed, a comprehensive digital twin framework with a realistic 3D environment with physics-based simulations. The iFAN ecosystem serves as a high-fidelity virtual testbed for plant operation, cybersecurity, physical security, and robotic operation, as it provides real-time data exchange for pre-deployment verification. Core features include virtual reality, reinforcement learning, radiation simulation, and cyber-physical security. In addition, the paper investigates various applications through potential operational scenarios. The iFAN ecosystem provides a versatile and secure architecture for validating the next generation of autonomous and cyber-resilient nuclear operations.
