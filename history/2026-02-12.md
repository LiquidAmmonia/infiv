### SurfPhase: 3D Interfacial Dynamics in Two-Phase Flows from Sparse Videos
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11154v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11154v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11154v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11154v1)

Interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows govern momentum, heat, and mass transfer, yet remain difficult to measure experimentally. Classical techniques face intrinsic limitations near moving interfaces, while existing neural rendering methods target single-phase flows with diffuse boundaries and cannot handle sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces. We propose SurfPhase, a novel model for reconstructing 3D interfacial dynamics from sparse camera views. Our approach integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and leverages a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations. We evaluate on a new dataset of high-speed pool boiling videos, demonstrating high-quality view synthesis and velocity estimation from only two camera views.

### Beyond VLM-Based Rewards: Diffusion-Native Latent Reward Modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11146v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11146v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11146v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11146v1)

Preference optimization for diffusion and flow-matching models relies on reward functions that are both discriminatively robust and computationally efficient. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the primary reward provider, leveraging their rich multimodal priors to guide alignment. However, their computation and memory cost can be substantial, and optimizing a latent diffusion generator through a pixel-space reward introduces a domain mismatch that complicates alignment. In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost. In preference optimization, we demonstrate that DiNa-LRM improves preference optimization dynamics, enabling faster and more resource-efficient model alignment.

### GENIUS: Generative Fluid Intelligence Evaluation Suite
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11144v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11144v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11144v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11144v1)

Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual generation. Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\textbf{U}$ation $\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free attention intervention strategy. Ultimately, $\textbf{GENIUS}$ establishes a rigorous standard for $\textit{GFI}$, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning. Our dataset and code will be released at: $\href{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}$.

### From Circuits to Dynamics: Understanding and Stabilizing Failure in 3D Diffusion Transformers
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11130v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11130v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11130v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11130v1)

Reliable surface completion from sparse point clouds underpins many applications spanning content creation and robotics. While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%. Overall, this work is a case study on how diffusion model behavior can be understood and guided based on mechanistic analysis, linking a circuit-level cross-attention mechanism to diffusion-dynamics accounts of trajectory bifurcations.

### PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11124v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11124v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11124v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11124v1)

With the rapid development of large multimodal models, reliable judge and critic models have become essential for open-ended evaluation and preference alignment, providing pairwise preferences, numerical scores, and explanatory justifications for assessing model-generated responses. However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.

### HairWeaver: Few-Shot Photorealistic Hair Motion Synthesis with Sim-to-Real Guided Video Diffusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11117v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11117v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11117v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11117v1)

2026/02/11 18:31 GTM

We present HairWeaver, a diffusion-based pipeline that animates a single human image with realistic and expressive hair dynamics. While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details.

### FastFlow: Accelerating The Generative Flow Matching Models with Bandit Inference
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11105v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11105v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11105v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11105v1)

2026/02/11 18:21 GTM

Flow-matching models deliver state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video generation, but the inherent sequential denoising process renders them slower. Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs. The source code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Div290/FastFlow.

### First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition: Methods, Results and Remaining Challenges
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11086v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11086v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11086v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11086v1)

2026/02/11 17:53 GTM

Biometric footstep recognition, based on a person's unique pressure patterns under their feet during walking, is an emerging field with growing applications in security and safety. However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy. Overall, the competition showcased strong solutions, but persistent challenges in generalizing to unfamiliar footwear highlight a critical area for future work.

### Chatting with Images for Introspective Visual Thinking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11073v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11073v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11073v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11073v1)

2026/02/11 17:42 GTM

Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.

### PuriLight: A Lightweight Shuffle and Purification Framework for Monocular Depth Estimation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11066v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11066v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11066v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11066v1)

2026/02/11 17:35 GTM

We propose PuriLight, a lightweight and efficient framework for self-supervised monocular depth estimation, to address the dual challenges of computational efficiency and detail preservation. While recent advances in self-supervised depth estimation have reduced reliance on ground truth supervision, existing approaches remain constrained by either bulky architectures compromising practicality or lightweight models sacrificing structural precision. These dual limitations underscore the critical need to develop lightweight yet structurally precise architectures. Our framework addresses these limitations through a three-stage architecture incorporating three novel modules: the Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC) module for local feature extraction, the Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA) module for hierarchical feature enhancement, and the Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) module for global feature purification. Through effective collaboration, these modules enable PuriLight to achieve both lightweight and accurate feature extraction and processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuriLight achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal training parameters while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency. Codes will be available at https://github.com/ishrouder/PuriLight.

### Chain-of-Look Spatial Reasoning for Dense Surgical Instrument Counting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11024v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11024v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11024v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11024v1)

2026/02/11 16:49 GTM

Accurate counting of surgical instruments in Operating Rooms (OR) is a critical prerequisite for ensuring patient safety during surgery. Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.

### ContactGaussian-WM: Learning Physics-Grounded World Model from Videos
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11021v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11021v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11021v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11021v1)

2026/02/11 16:48 GTM

Developing world models that understand complex physical interactions is essential for advancing robotic planning and simulation.However, existing methods often struggle to accurately model the environment under conditions of data scarcity and complex contact-rich dynamic motion.To address these challenges, we propose ContactGaussian-WM, a differentiable physics-grounded rigid-body world model capable of learning intricate physical laws directly from sparse and contact-rich video sequences.Our framework consists of two core components: (1) a unified Gaussian representation for both visual appearance and collision geometry, and (2) an end-to-end differentiable learning framework that differentiates through a closed-form physics engine to infer physical properties from sparse visual observations.Extensive simulations and real-world evaluations demonstrate that ContactGaussian-WM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in learning complex scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.Furthermore, we showcase the practical utility of our framework in downstream applications, including data synthesis and real-time MPC.

### LaSSM: Efficient Semantic-Spatial Query Decoding via Local Aggregation and State Space Models for 3D Instance Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11007v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11007v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11007v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11007v1)

2026/02/11 16:34 GTM

Query-based 3D scene instance segmentation from point clouds has attained notable performance. However, existing methods suffer from the query initialization dilemma due to the sparse nature of point clouds and rely on computationally intensive attention mechanisms in query decoders. We accordingly introduce LaSSM, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical semantic-spatial query initializer to derive the query set from superpoints by considering both semantic cues and spatial distribution, achieving comprehensive scene coverage and accelerated convergence. We further present a coordinate-guided state space model (SSM) decoder that progressively refines queries. The novel decoder features a local aggregation scheme that restricts the model to focus on geometrically coherent regions and a spatial dual-path SSM block to capture underlying dependencies within the query set by integrating associated coordinates information. Our design enables efficient instance prediction, avoiding the incorporation of noisy information and reducing redundant computation. LaSSM ranks first place on the latest ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard, outperforming the previous best method by 2.5% mAP with only 1/3 FLOPs, demonstrating its superiority in challenging large-scale scene instance segmentation. LaSSM also achieves competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3DIS and ScanNet++ V1 benchmarks with less computational cost. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative results validate the effectiveness of our design. The code and weights are available at https://github.com/RayYoh/LaSSM.

### Interpretable Vision Transformers in Monocular Depth Estimation via SVDA
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11005v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11005v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11005v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11005v1)

2026/02/11 16:27 GTM

Monocular depth estimation is a central problem in computer vision with applications in robotics, AR, and autonomous driving, yet the self-attention mechanisms that drive modern Transformer architectures remain opaque. We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.

### Enhancing Predictability of Multi-Tenant DNN Inference for Autonomous Vehicles' Perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11004v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11004v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11004v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11004v1)

2026/02/11 16:25 GTM

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.

### Interpretable Vision Transformers in Image Classification via SVDA
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10994v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10994v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10994v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10994v1)

2026/02/11 16:20 GTM

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification, yet their attention mechanisms often remain opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors. In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.

### DFIC: Towards a balanced facial image dataset for automatic ICAO compliance verification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10985v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10985v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10985v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10985v1)

Ensuring compliance with ISO/IEC and ICAO standards for facial images in machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs) is essential for reliable identity verification, but current manual inspection methods are inefficient in high-demand environments. This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.
  Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems.

### VFGS-Net: Frequency-Guided State-Space Learning for Topology-Preserving Retinal Vessel Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10978v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10978v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10978v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10978v1)

2026/02/11 16:07 GTM

Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential.

### Healthy Harvests: A Comparative Look at Guava Disease Classification Using InceptionV3

Guava fruits often suffer from many diseases. This can harm fruit quality and fruit crop yield. Early identification is important for minimizing damage and ensuring fruit health. This study focuses on 3 different categories for classifying diseases. These are Anthracnose, Fruit flies, and Healthy fruit. The data set used in this study is collected from Mendeley Data. This dataset contains 473 original images of Guava. These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency. After this, the Data augmentation process is applied to improve the dataset by generating variations of the original images. The augmented dataset consists of 3784 images using advanced preprocessing techniques. Two deep learning models were implemented to classify the images. The InceptionV3 model is well known for its advanced framework. These apply multiple convolutional filters for obtaining different features effectively. On the other hand, the ResNet50 model helps to train deeper networks by using residual learning. The InceptionV3 model achieved the impressive accuracy of 98.15%, and ResNet50got 94.46% accuracy. Data mixing methods such as CutMix and MixUp were applied to enhance the model's robustness. The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the overall model performance of both InceptionV3 and Resnet50. Additionally, SHAP analysis is used to improve interpretability, which helps to find the significant parts of the image for the model prediction. This study purposes to highlight how advanced models enhan

### Towards Learning a Generalizable 3D Scene Representation from 2D Observations

We introduce a Generalizable Neural Radiance Field approach for predicting 3D workspace occupancy from egocentric robot observations. Unlike prior methods operating in camera-centric coordinates, our model constructs occupancy representations in a global workspace frame, making it directly applicable to robotic manipulation. The model integrates flexible source views and generalizes to unseen object arrangements without scene-specific finetuning. We demonstrate the approach on a humanoid robot and evaluate predicted geometry against 3D sensor ground truth. Trained on 40 real scenes, our model achieves 26mm reconstruction error, including occluded regions, validating its ability to infer complete 3D occupancy beyond traditional stereo vision methods.

### FastUSP: A Multi-Level Collaborative Acceleration Framework for Distributed Diffusion Model Inference
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10940v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10940v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10940v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10940v1)

Large-scale diffusion models such as FLUX (12B parameters) and Stable Diffusion 3 (8B parameters) require multi-GPU parallelism for efficient inference. Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \textbf{1.12$\times$--1.16$\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \textbf{1.09$\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\times$--1.46$\times$ of 2-GPU performance. We further provide a detailed analysis of the performance characteristics of distributed diffusion inference, revealing that kernel launch overhead -- rather than communication latency -- is the primary bottleneck on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects.

### ResWorld: Temporal Residual World Model for End-to-End Autonomous Driving

The comprehensive understanding capabilities of world models for driving scenarios have significantly improved the planning accuracy of end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks. However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance. The code is available at https://github.com/mengtan00/ResWorld.git.

### Chart Specification: Structural Representations for Incentivizing VLM Reasoning in Chart-to-Code Generation

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating plotting code from chart images, yet achieving structural fidelity remains challenging. Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

### Stride-Net: Fairness-Aware Disentangled Representation Learning for Chest X-Ray Diagnosis

Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification achieve strong average performance, yet often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising critical concerns about clinical safety and equity. Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/Daraksh/Fairness_StrideNet.

### Viewpoint Recommendation for Point Cloud Labeling through Interaction Cost Modeling

Semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds is important for many applications, such as autonomous driving. To train semantic segmentation models, labeled point cloud segmentation datasets are essential. Meanwhile, point cloud labeling is time-consuming for annotators, which typically involves tuning the camera viewpoint and selecting points by lasso. To reduce the time cost of point cloud labeling, we propose a viewpoint recommendation approach to reduce annotators' labeling time costs. We adapt Fitts' law to model the time cost of lasso selection in point clouds. Using the modeled time cost, the viewpoint that minimizes the lasso selection time cost is recommended to the annotator. We build a data labeling system for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds that integrates our viewpoint recommendation approach. The system enables users to navigate to recommended viewpoints for efficient annotation. Through an ablation study, we observed that our approach effectively reduced the data labeling time cost. We also qualitatively compare our approach with previous viewpoint selection approaches on different datasets.

### Hyperspectral Smoke Segmentation via Mixture of Prototypes
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10858v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10858v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10858v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10858v1)

Smoke segmentation is critical for wildfire management and industrial safety applications. Traditional visible-light-based methods face limitations due to insufficient spectral information, particularly struggling with cloud interference and semi-transparent smoke regions. To address these challenges, we introduce hyperspectral imaging for smoke segmentation and present the first hyperspectral smoke segmentation dataset (HSSDataset) with carefully annotated samples collected from over 18,000 frames across 20 real-world scenarios using a Many-to-One annotations protocol. However, different spectral bands exhibit varying discriminative capabilities across spatial regions, necessitating adaptive band weighting strategies. We decompose this into three technical challenges: spectral interaction contamination, limited spectral pattern modeling, and complex weighting router problems. We propose a mixture of prototypes (MoP) network with: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting. We further construct a multispectral dataset (MSSDataset) with RGB-infrared images. Extensive experiments validate superior performance across both hyperspectral and multispectral modalities, establishing a new paradigm for spectral-based smoke segmentation.

### Flow caching for autoregressive video generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10825v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10825v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10825v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10825v1)

2026/02/11 13:11 GTM

Autoregressive models, often built on Transformer architectures, represent a powerful paradigm for generating ultra-long videos by synthesizing content in sequential chunks. However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale. The code is available at https://github.com/mikeallen39/FlowCache.

### Resource-Efficient RGB-Only Action Recognition for Edge Deployment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10818v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10818v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10818v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10818v1)

Action recognition on edge devices poses stringent constraints on latency, memory, storage, and power consumption. While auxiliary modalities such as skeleton and depth information can enhance recognition performance, they often require additional sensors or computationally expensive pose-estimation pipelines, limiting practicality for edge use. In this work, we propose a compact RGB-only network tailored for efficient on-device inference. Our approach builds upon an X3D-style backbone augmented with Temporal Shift, and further introduces selective temporal adaptation and parameter-free attention. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 benchmarks demonstrate a strong accuracy-efficiency balance. Moreover, deployment-level profiling on the Jetson Orin Nano verifies a smaller on-device footprint and practical resource utilization compared to existing RGB-based action recognition techniques.

### Why Does RL Generalize Better Than SFT? A Data-Centric Perspective on VLM Post-Training
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10815v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10815v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10815v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10815v1)

The adaptation of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through post-training reveals a pronounced generalization gap: models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) consistently achieve superior out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to those trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/byyx666/DC-SFT.

### DeepImageSearch: Benchmarking Multimodal Agents for Context-Aware Image Retrieval in Visual Histories
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10809v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10809v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10809v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10809v1)

Existing multimodal retrieval systems excel at semantic matching but implicitly assume that query-image relevance can be measured in isolation. This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.

### DMP-3DAD: Cross-Category 3D Anomaly Detection via Realistic Depth Map Projection with Few Normal Samples
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10806v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10806v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10806v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10806v1)

Cross-category anomaly detection for 3D point clouds aims to determine whether an unseen object belongs to a target category using only a few normal examples. Most existing methods rely on category-specific training, which limits their flexibility in few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose DMP-3DAD, a training-free framework for cross-category 3D anomaly detection based on multi-view realistic depth map projection. Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNetPart dataset demonstrate that DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot setting. The results show that the proposed approach provides a simple yet effective solution for practical cross-category 3D anomaly detection.

### RSHallu: Dual-Mode Hallucination Evaluation for Remote-Sensing Multimodal Large Language Models with Domain-Tailored Mitigation

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly adopted in remote sensing (RS) and have shown strong performance on tasks such as RS visual grounding (RSVG), RS visual question answering (RSVQA), and multimodal dialogue. However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG). Code and datasets will be released.

### Kill it with FIRE: On Leveraging Latent Space Directions for Runtime Backdoor Mitigation in Deep Neural Networks

Machine learning models are increasingly present in our everyday lives; as a result, they become targets of adversarial attackers seeking to manipulate the systems we interact with. A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.

### From Steering to Pedalling: Do Autonomous Driving VLMs Generalize to Cyclist-Assistive Spatial Perception and Planning?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10771v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10771v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10771v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10771v1)

Cyclists often encounter safety-critical situations in urban traffic, highlighting the need for assistive systems that support safe and informed decision-making. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.

### Dual-End Consistency Model

The slow iterative sampling nature remains a major bottleneck for the practical deployment of diffusion and flow-based generative models. While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.

Computer graphics, comprising both raster and vector components, is a fundamental part of modern science, industry, and digital communication. While raster graphics offer ease of use, its pixel-based structure limits scalability. Vector graphics, defined by mathematical primitives, provides scalability without quality loss, however, it is more complex to produce. For design and architecture, the versatility of vector graphics is paramount, despite its computational demands. This paper introduces a novel method for generating vector residential plans from textual descriptions. Our approach surpasses existing solutions by approximately 5% in CLIPScore-based visual quality, benefiting from its inherent handling of right angles and flexible settings. Additionally, we present a new algorithm for vectorizing raster plans into structured vector images. Such images have a better CLIPscore compared to others by about 4%.

### SecureScan: An AI-Driven Multi-Layer Framework for Malware and Phishing Detection Using Logistic Regression and Threat Intelligence Integration

The growing sophistication of modern malware and phishing campaigns has diminished the effectiveness of traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems. This work presents SecureScan, an AI-driven, triple-layer detection framework that integrates logistic regression-based classification, heuristic analysis, and external threat intelligence via the VirusTotal API for comprehensive triage of URLs, file hashes, and binaries. The proposed architecture prioritizes efficiency by filtering known threats through heuristics, classifying uncertain samples using machine learning, and validating borderline cases with third-party intelligence. On benchmark datasets, SecureScan achieves 93.1 percent accuracy with balanced precision (0.87) and recall (0.92), demonstrating strong generalization and reduced overfitting through threshold-based decision calibration. A calibrated threshold and gray-zone logic (0.45-0.55) were introduced to minimize false positives and enhance real-world stability. Experimental results indicate that a lightweight statistical model, when augmented with calibrated verification and external intelligence, can achieve reliability and performance comparable to more complex deep learning systems.

### Spectral-Spatial Contrastive Learning Framework for Regression on Hyperspectral Data

Contrastive learning has demonstrated great success in representation learning, especially for image classification tasks. However, there is still a shortage in studies targeting regression tasks, and more specifically applications on hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a spectral-spatial contrastive learning framework for regression tasks for hyperspectral data, in a model-agnostic design allowing to enhance backbones such as 3D convolutional and transformer-based networks. Moreover, we provide a collection of transformations relevant for augmenting hyperspectral data. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed framework and transformations significantly improve the performance of all studied backbone models.

### Self-Supervised Image Super-Resolution Quality Assessment based on Content-Free Multi-Model Oriented Representation Learning

Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.

[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10728v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10728v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10728v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10728v1)

Accurate facial landmark detection under occlusion remains challenging, especially for human-like faces with large appearance variation and rotation-driven self-occlusion. Existing detectors typically localize landmarks while handling occlusion implicitly, without predicting per-point visibility that downstream applications can benefits. We present OccFace, an occlusion-aware framework for universal human-like faces, including humans, stylized characters, and other non-human designs. OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap. We also create an occlusion-aware evaluation suite reporting NME on visible vs. occluded landmarks and benchmarking visibility with Occ AP, F1@0.5, and ROC-AUC, together with a dataset annotated with 100-point landmarks and per-point visibility. Experiments show improved robustness under external occlusion and large head rotations, especially on occluded regions, while preserving accuracy on visible landmarks.

The reconstruction of X-rays CT images from sparse or limited-angle geometries is a highly challenging task. The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction.

### Ecological mapping with geospatial foundation models

Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) are a fast-emerging paradigm for various geospatial tasks, such as ecological mapping. However, the utility of GFMs has not been fully explored for high-value use cases. This study aims to explore the utility, challenges and opportunities associated with the application of GFMs for ecological uses. In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models. Nonetheless, consideration should be given to the divergence of input data from pretrained modalities. We note that these models would benefit from higher resolution and more accurate labels, especially for use cases where pixel-level dynamics need to be mapped.

### From Representational Complementarity to Dual Systems: Synergizing VLM and Vision-Only Backbones for End-to-End Driving
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10719v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10719v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10719v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10719v1)

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) driving augments end-to-end (E2E) planning with language-enabled backbones, yet it remains unclear what changes beyond the usual accuracy--cost trade-off. We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x. Code will be released.

### FGAA-FPN: Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for Oriented Object Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10710v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10710v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10710v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10710v1)

With the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and aerial imagery, oriented object detection has become a key capability for geographic information updating, maritime surveillance, and disaster response. However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.

### (MGS)$^2$-Net: Unifying Micro-Geometric Scale and Macro-Geometric Structure for Cross-View Geo-Localization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10704v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10704v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10704v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10704v1)

Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\% on University-1652 and 97.02\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity. The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/GabrielLi1473/MGS-Net}{https://github.com/GabrielLi1473/MGS-Net}.

### AugVLA-3D: Depth-Driven Feature Augmentation for Vision-Language-Action Models

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems.

### OmniVL-Guard: Towards Unified Vision-Language Forgery Detection and Grounding via Balanced RL

Existing forgery detection methods are often limited to uni-modal or bi-modal settings, failing to handle the interleaved text, images, and videos prevalent in real-world misinformation. To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits zero-shot robust generalization across out-of-domain scenarios.

### TwiFF (Think With Future Frames): A Large-Scale Dataset for Dynamic Visual Reasoning

Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing multimodal reasoning by integrating visual perception into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing VCoT approaches are largely confined to static scenarios and struggle to capture the temporal dynamics essential for tasks such as instruction, prediction, and camera motion. To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT methods and Textual Chain-of-Thought baselines on dynamic reasoning tasks, which fully validates the effectiveness for visual question answering in dynamic scenarios.

Background: Automated podocyte foot process quantification is vital for kidney research, but the established "Automatic Morphological Analysis of Podocytes" (AMAP) method is hindered by high computational demands, a lack of a user interface, and Linux dependency. We developed AMAP-APP, a cross-platform desktop application designed to overcome these barriers.
  Methods: AMAP-APP optimizes efficiency by replacing intensive instance segmentation with classic image processing while retaining the original semantic segmentation model. It introduces a refined Region of Interest (ROI) algorithm to improve precision. Validation involved 365 mouse and human images (STED and confocal), benchmarking performance against the original AMAP via Pearson correlation and Two One-Sided T-tests (TOST).
  Results: AMAP-APP achieved a 147-fold increase in processing speed on consumer hardware. Morphometric outputs (area, perimeter, circularity, and slit diaphragm density) showed high correlation (r>0.90) and statistical equivalence (TOST P<0.05) to the original method. Additionally, the new ROI algorithm demonstrated superior accuracy compared to the original, showing reduced deviation from manual delineations.
  Conclusion: AMAP-APP democratizes deep learning-based podocyte morphometry. By eliminating the need for high-performance computing clusters and providing a user-friendly interface for Windows, macOS, and Linux, it enables widespread adoption in nephrology research and potential clinical diagnostics.

### Dynamic Frequency Modulation for Controllable Text-driven Image Generation

The success of text-guided diffusion models has established a new image generation paradigm driven by the iterative refinement of text prompts. However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.

Self-driving cars hold significant potential to reduce traffic accidents, alleviate congestion, and enhance urban mobility. However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%. Additionally, we validate the practical feasibility of AurigaNet by deploying it on embedded devices such as the Jetson Orin NX, where it demonstrates competitive real-time performance. These results underscore AurigaNet's potential as a robust and efficient solution for autonomous driving perception systems. The code can be found here https://github.com/KiaRational/AurigaNet.

### Multimodal Priors-Augmented Text-Driven 3D Human-Object Interaction Generation

We address the challenging task of text-driven 3D human-object interaction (HOI) motion generation. Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation. (3) Multimodal-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Model: We propose a modality-aware MoE model for effective multimodal feature fusion paradigm, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in feature fusion. (4) Cascaded Diffusion with Interaction Supervision: We design a cascaded diffusion framework that progressively refines human-object interaction features under dedicated supervision, which tackles Q3 in interaction refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MP-HOI outperforms existing approaches in generating high-fidelity and fine-grained HOI motions.

### VideoSTF: Stress-Testing Output Repetition in Video Large Language Models

Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at: https://github.com/yuxincao22/VideoSTF_benchmark.

### Eliminating VAE for Fast and High-Resolution Generative Detail Restoration

Diffusion models have attained remarkable breakthroughs in the real-world super-resolution (SR) task, albeit at slow inference and high demand on devices. To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR. Against all odds, GenDR-Pix can restore 4K image in only 1 second and 6GB.

Medical foundation models have shown promise in controlled benchmarks, yet widespread deployment remains hindered by reliance on task-specific fine-tuning. Here, we introduce DermFM-Zero, a dermatology vision-language foundation model trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment. In collaborative workflows, AI assistance enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts while improving management appropriateness. Finally, we show that DermFM-Zero's latent representations are interpretable: sparse autoencoders unsupervisedly disentangle clinically meaningful concepts that outperform predefined-vocabulary approaches and enable targeted suppression of artifact-induced biases, enhancing robustness without retraining. These findings demonstrate that a foundation model can provide effective, safe, and transparent zero-shot clinical decision support.

### Improving Medical Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning via Perception and Reasoning Augmentation

While recent advances in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) have shown that rule-based reward schemes can enable effective post-training for large language models, their extension to cross-modal, vision-centric domains remains largely underexplored. This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.
  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks. We hope this work contributes actionable guidance and fresh inspiration for the ongoing effort to develop reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications.

Recently, Image processing has advanced Faster and applied in many fields, including health, industry, and transportation. In the transportation sector, object detection is widely used to improve security, for example, in traffic security and passenger crossings at train stations. Some accidents occur in the train crossing area at the station, like passengers uncarefully when passing through the yellow line. So further security needs to be developed. Additional technology is required to reduce the number of accidents. This paper focuses on passenger detection applications at train stations using YOLOX and Edge AI Accelerator hardware. the performance of the AI accelerator will be compared with Jetson Orin Nano. The experimental results show that the Hailo-8 AI hardware accelerator has higher accuracy than Jetson Orin Nano (improvement of over 12%) and has lower latency than Jetson Orin Nano (reduced 20 ms).

### Enhancing YOLOv11n for Reliable Child Detection in Noisy Surveillance Footage

This paper presents a practical and lightweight solution for enhancing child detection in low-quality surveillance footage, a critical component in real-world missing child alert and daycare monitoring systems. Building upon the efficient YOLOv11n architecture, we propose a deployment-ready pipeline that improves detection under challenging conditions including occlusion, small object size, low resolution, motion blur, and poor lighting commonly found in existing CCTV infrastructures. Our approach introduces a domain-specific augmentation strategy that synthesizes realistic child placements using spatial perturbations such as partial visibility, truncation, and overlaps, combined with photometric degradations including lighting variation and noise. To improve recall of small and partially occluded instances, we integrate Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) at inference time. All components are trained and evaluated on a filtered, child-only subset of the Roboflow Daycare dataset. Compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, our enhanced system achieves a mean Average Precision at 0.5 IoU (mAP@0.5) of 0.967 and a mean Average Precision averaged over IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95) of 0.783, yielding absolute improvements of 0.7 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, without architectural changes. Importantly, the entire pipeline maintains compatibility with low-power edge devices and supports real-time performance, making it particularly well suited for low-cost or resource-constrained industrial surveillance deployments.

### Enhancing Underwater Images via Adaptive Semantic-aware Codebook Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10586v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10586v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10586v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10586v1)

Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) is an ill-posed problem where natural clean references are not available, and the degradation levels vary significantly across semantic regions. Existing UIE methods treat images with a single global model and ignore the inconsistent degradation of different scene components. This oversight leads to significant color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes, especially where degradation varies significantly across different image regions. Therefore, we propose SUCode (Semantic-aware Underwater Codebook Network), which achieves adaptive UIE from semantic-aware discrete codebook representation. Compared with one-shot codebook-based methods, SUCode exploits semantic-aware, pixel-level codebook representation tailored to heterogeneous underwater degradation. A three-stage training paradigm is employed to represent raw underwater image features to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination. Gated Channel Attention Module (GCAM) and Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FAFF) jointly integrate channel and frequency cues for faithful color restoration and texture recovery. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SUCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent UIE methods on both reference and no-reference metrics. The code will be made public available at https://github.com/oucailab/SUCode.

### MetaphorStar: Image Metaphor Understanding and Reasoning with End-to-End Visual Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10575v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10575v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10575v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10575v1)

Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for Nowadays AI systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.
  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method. We open-sourced all model weights, datasets, and method code at https://metaphorstar.github.io.

### Diffusion-Pretrained Dense and Contextual Embeddings

In this report, we introduce pplx-embed, a family of multilingual embedding models that employ multi-stage contrastive learning on a diffusion-pretrained language model backbone for web-scale retrieval. By leveraging bidirectional attention through diffusion-based pretraining, our models capture comprehensive bidirectional context within passages, enabling the use of mean pooling and a late chunking strategy to better preserve global context across long documents. We release two model types: pplx-embed-v1 for standard retrieval, and pplx-embed-context-v1 for contextualized embeddings that incorporate global document context into passage representations. pplx-embed-v1 achieves competitive performance on the MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN, and ToolRet retrieval benchmarks, while pplx-embed-context-v1 sets new records on the ConTEB benchmark. Beyond public benchmarks, pplx-embed-v1 demonstrates strong performance on our internal evaluation suite, which focuses on real-world, large-scale search scenarios over tens of millions of documents. These results validate the models' effectiveness in production environments where retrieval quality and efficiency are critical at scale.

### Data Repetition Beats Data Scaling in Long-CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11149v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11149v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11149v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11149v1)

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data is an essential post-training step for reasoning language models. Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models.

### Weight Decay Improves Language Model Plasticity

The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.

### Just on Time: Token-Level Early Stopping for Diffusion Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11133v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11133v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11133v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11133v1)

Diffusion language models generate text through iterative refinement, a process that is often computationally inefficient because many tokens reach stability long before the final denoising step. We introduce a training-free, token-level early stopping approach that identifies convergence independently at each position. Our method leverages lightweight signals derived from the model's predictions and local context to dynamically determine when individual tokens can be finalized. This yields adaptive per-token freezing without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the total number of diffusion steps required. Across diverse benchmarks, spanning mathematical reasoning, general question answering, and scientific understanding, our approach achieves state-of-the-art efficiency gains while preserving generation quality.

### TEGRA: Text Encoding With Graph and Retrieval Augmentation for Misinformation Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11106v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11106v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11106v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11106v1)

2026/02/11 18:21 GTM

Misinformation detection is a critical task that can benefit significantly from the integration of external knowledge, much like manual fact-checking. In this work, we propose a novel method for representing textual documents that facilitates the incorporation of information from a knowledge base. Our approach, Text Encoding with Graph (TEG), processes documents by extracting structured information in the form of a graph and encoding both the text and the graph for classification purposes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this hybrid representation enhances misinformation detection performance compared to using language models alone. Furthermore, we introduce TEGRA, an extension of our framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge, further enhancing classification accuracy in most cases.

### GameDevBench: Evaluating Agentic Capabilities Through Game Development
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11103v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11103v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11103v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11103v1)

Despite rapid progress on coding agents, progress on their multimodal counterparts has lagged behind. A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%. We release GameDevBench publicly to support further research into agentic game development.

### Safety Recovery in Reasoning Models Is Only a Few Early Steering Steps Away
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11096v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11096v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11096v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11096v1)

Reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training for explicit chain-of-thought (e.g., GRPO) improves the reasoning ability of multimodal large-scale reasoning models (MLRMs). But recent evidence shows that it can simultaneously degrade safety alignment and increase jailbreak success rates. We propose SafeThink, a lightweight inference-time defense that treats safety recovery as a satisficing constraint rather than a maximization objective. SafeThink monitors the evolving reasoning trace with a safety reward model and conditionally injects an optimized short corrective prefix ("Wait, think safely") only when the safety threshold is violated. In our evaluations across six open-source MLRMs and four jailbreak benchmarks (JailbreakV-28K, Hades, FigStep, and MM-SafetyBench), SafeThink reduces attack success rates by 30-60% (e.g., LlamaV-o1: 63.33% to 5.74% on JailbreakV-28K, R1-Onevision: 69.07% to 5.65% on Hades) while preserving reasoning performance (MathVista accuracy: 65.20% to 65.00%). A key empirical finding from our experiments is that safety recovery is often only a few steering steps away: intervening in the first 1-3 reasoning steps typically suffices to redirect the full generation toward safe completions.

### Can Large Language Models Make Everyone Happy?

Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the failure to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, leading to behaviors that diverge from human expectations in real-world settings where these dimensions must co-occur. Existing benchmarks, such as SAFETUNEBED (safety-centric), VALUEBENCH (value-centric), and WORLDVIEW-BENCH (culture-centric), primarily evaluate these dimensions in isolation and therefore provide limited insight into their interactions and trade-offs. More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains. In addition to domain labels, each prompt is classified with one of three orthogonal semantic types-object, attribute, or relations misalignment-using Gemma-2-9B-it and expanded via Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 with SimHash-based fingerprinting to avoid deduplication. Each prompt is paired with misaligned and aligned responses through two-stage rejection sampling to ensure quality. Second, we benchmark general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs on MISALIGNTRADE-revealing 12%-34% misalignment trade-offs across dimensions.

### DataChef: Cooking Up Optimal Data Recipes for LLM Adaptation via Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11089v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11089v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11089v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11089v1)

In the current landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), the curation of large-scale, high-quality training data is a primary driver of model performance. A key lever is the \emph{data recipe}, which comprises a data processing pipeline to transform raw sources into training corpora. Despite the growing use of LLMs to automate individual data processing steps, such as data synthesis and filtering, the overall design of data recipes remains largely manual and labor-intensive, requiring substantial human expertise and iteration. To bridge this gap, we formulate \emph{end-to-end data recipe generation} for LLM adaptation. Given a target benchmark and a pool of available data sources, a model is required to output a complete data recipe that adapts a base LLM to the target task. We present DataChef-32B, which performs online reinforcement learning using a proxy reward that predicts downstream performance for candidate recipes. Across six held-out tasks, DataChef-32B produces practical recipes that reach comparable downstream performance to those curated by human experts. Notably, the recipe from DataChef-32B adapts Qwen3-1.7B-Base to the math domain, achieving 66.7 on AIME'25 and surpassing Qwen3-1.7B. This work sheds new light on automating LLM training and developing self-evolving AI systems.

### SteuerLLM: Local specialized large language model for German tax law analysis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11081v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11081v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11081v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11081v1)

Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning and language understanding, yet their performance degrades in domains governed by strict formal rules, precise terminology, and legally binding structure. Tax law exemplifies these challenges, as correct answers require exact statutory citation, structured legal argumentation, and numerical accuracy under rigid grading schemes. We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice. We further present SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM for German tax law trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset generated from authentic examination material using a controlled retrieval-augmented pipeline. SteuerLLM (28B parameters) consistently outperforms general-purpose instruction-tuned models of comparable size and, in several cases, substantially larger systems, demonstrating that domain-specific data and architectural adaptation are more decisive than parameter scale for performance on realistic legal reasoning tasks. All benchmark data, training datasets, model weights, and evaluation code are released openly to support reproducible research in domain-specific legal artificial intelligence. A web-based demo of SteuerLLM is available at https://steuerllm.i5.ai.fau.de.

### Chatting with Images for Introspective Visual Thinking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11073v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11073v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11073v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11073v1)

2026/02/11 17:42 GTM

Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.

### Simultaneous Speech-to-Speech Translation Without Aligned Data
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11072v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11072v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11072v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11072v1)

Simultaneous speech translation requires translating source speech into a target language in real-time while handling non-monotonic word dependencies. Traditional approaches rely on supervised training with word-level aligned data, which is difficult to collect at scale and thus depends on synthetic alignments using language-specific heuristics that are suboptimal. We propose Hibiki-Zero, which eliminates the need for word-level alignments entirely. This fundamentally simplifies the training pipeline and enables seamless scaling to diverse languages with varying grammatical structures, removing the bottleneck of designing language-specific alignment heuristics. We first train on sentence-level aligned data to learn speech translation at high latency, then apply a novel reinforcement learning strategy using GRPO to optimize latency while preserving translation quality. Hibiki-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance in translation accuracy, latency, voice transfer, and naturalness across five X-to-English tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be adapted to support a new input language with less than 1000h of speech. We provide examples, model weights, inference code and we release a benchmark containing 45h of multilingual data for speech translation evaluation.

### Conversational Behavior Modeling Foundation Model With Multi-Level Perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11065v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11065v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11065v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11065v1)

Human conversation is organized by an implicit chain of thoughts that manifests as timed speech acts. Capturing this perceptual pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that models this process as multi-level perception, and then reasons over conversational behaviors via a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.

### GraphSeek: Next-Generation Graph Analytics with LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11052v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11052v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11052v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11052v1)

2026/02/11 17:20 GTM

Graphs are foundational across domains but remain hard to use without deep expertise. LLMs promise accessible natural language (NL) graph analytics, yet they fail to process industry-scale property graphs effectively and efficiently: such datasets are large, highly heterogeneous, structurally complex, and evolve dynamically. To address this, we devise a novel abstraction for complex multi-query analytics over such graphs. Its key idea is to replace brittle generation of graph queries directly from NL with planning over a Semantic Catalog that describes both the graph schema and the graph operations. Concretely, this induces a clean separation between a Semantic Plane for LLM planning and broader reasoning, and an Execution Plane for deterministic, database-grade query execution over the full dataset and tool implementations. This design yields substantial gains in both token efficiency and task effectiveness even with small-context LLMs. We use this abstraction as the basis of the first LLM-enhanced graph analytics framework called GraphSeek. GraphSeek achieves substantially higher success rates (e.g., 86% over enhanced LangChain) and points toward the next generation of affordable and accessible graph analytics that unify LLM reasoning with database-grade execution over large and complex property graphs.

### Embedding Inversion via Conditional Masked Diffusion Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11047v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11047v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11047v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11047v1)

2026/02/11 17:17 GTM

We frame embedding inversion as conditional masked diffusion, recovering all tokens in parallel through iterative denoising rather than sequential autoregressive generation. A masked diffusion language model is conditioned on the target embedding via adaptive layer normalization, requiring only 8 forward passes through a 78M parameter model with no access to the target encoder. On 32-token sequences across three embedding models, the method achieves 81.3% token accuracy and 0.87 cosine similarity.

### Language Model Inversion through End-to-End Differentiation

Despite emerging research on Language Models (LM), few approaches analyse the invertibility of LMs. That is, given a LM and a desirable target output sequence of tokens, determining what input prompts would yield the target output remains an open problem. We formulate this problem as a classical gradient-based optimisation. First, we propose a simple algorithm to achieve end-to-end differentiability of a given (frozen) LM and then find optimised prompts via gradient descent. Our central insight is to view LMs as functions operating on sequences of distributions over tokens (rather than the traditional view as functions on sequences of tokens). Our experiments and ablations demonstrate that our DLM-powered inversion can reliably and efficiently optimise prompts of lengths $10$ and $80$ for targets of length $20$, for several white-box LMs (out-of-the-box).

### Learning Page Order in Shuffled WOO Releases
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11040v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11040v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11040v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11040v1)

2026/02/11 17:11 GTM

We investigate document page ordering on 5,461 shuffled WOO documents (Dutch freedom of information releases) using page embeddings. These documents are heterogeneous collections such as emails, legal texts, and spreadsheets compiled into single PDFs, where semantic ordering signals are unreliable. We compare five methods, including pointer networks, seq2seq transformers, and specialized pairwise ranking models. The best performing approach successfully reorders documents up to 15 pages, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.95 for short documents (2-5 pages) to 0.72 for 15 page documents. We observe two unexpected failures: seq2seq transformers fail to generalize on long documents (Kendall's tau drops from 0.918 on 2-5 pages to 0.014 on 21-25 pages), and curriculum learning underperforms direct training by 39% on long documents. Ablation studies suggest learned positional encodings are one contributing factor to seq2seq failure, though the degradation persists across all encoding variants, indicating multiple interacting causes. Attention pattern analysis reveals that short and long documents require fundamentally different ordering strategies, explaining why curriculum learning fails. Model specialization achieves substantial improvements on longer documents (+0.21 tau).

### Linguistic Indicators of Early Cognitive Decline in the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus: A Statistical and Machine Learning Study
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11028v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11028v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11028v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11028v1)

2026/02/11 16:53 GTM

Background: Subtle changes in spontaneous language production are among the earliest indicators of cognitive decline. Identifying linguistically interpretable markers of dementia can support transparent and clinically grounded screening approaches.
  Methods: This study analyzes spontaneous speech transcripts from the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus using three linguistic representations: raw cleaned text, a part-of-speech (POS)-enhanced representation combining lexical and grammatical information, and a POS-only syntactic representation. Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap. Model interpretability was examined using global feature importance, and statistical validation was conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes.
  Results: Across representations, models achieved stable performance, with syntactic and grammatical features retaining strong discriminative power even in the absence of lexical content. Subject-level evaluation yielded more conservative but consistent results, particularly for POS-enhanced and POS-only representations. Statistical analysis revealed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence, aligning closely with machine learning feature importance findings.
  Conclusion: The results demonstrate that abstract linguistic features capture robust markers of early cognitive decline under clinically realistic evaluation. By combining interpretable machine learning with non-parametric statistical validation, this study supports the use of linguistically grounded features for transparent and reliable language-based cognitive screening.

### ROCKET: Rapid Optimization via Calibration-guided Knapsack Enhanced Truncation for Efficient Model Compression
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11008v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11008v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11008v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11008v1)

2026/02/11 16:34 GTM

We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\% of the original model's performance at 30\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.

### The emergence of numerical representations in communicating artificial agents

Human languages provide efficient systems for expressing numerosities, but whether the sheer pressure to communicate is enough for numerical representations to arise in artificial agents, and whether the emergent codes resemble human numerals at all, remains an open question. We study two neural network-based agents that must communicate numerosities in a referential game using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches, thus exploring both symbolic and iconic representations. Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous). We conclude that the communication pressure alone suffices for precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed to yield compositional codes and generalisation abilities.

### LoRA-Squeeze: Simple and Effective Post-Tuning and In-Tuning Compression of LoRA Modules

Despite its huge number of variants, standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is still a dominant technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off.

### Rotary Positional Embeddings as Phase Modulation: Theoretical Bounds on the RoPE Base for Long-Context Transformers
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10959v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10959v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10959v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10959v1)

Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) are widely used in large language models to encode token positions through multiplicative rotations, yet their behavior at long context lengths remains poorly characterized. In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.
  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.
  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.
  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training.

### Search or Accelerate: Confidence-Switched Position Beam Search for Diffusion Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10953v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10953v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10953v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10953v1)

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) generate text by iteratively denoising a masked sequence, repeatedly deciding which positions to commit at each step. Standard decoding follows a greedy rule: unmask the most confident positions, yet this local choice can lock the model into a suboptimal unmasking order, especially on reasoning-heavy prompts. We present SOAR, a training-free decoding algorithm that adapts its behavior to the model's uncertainty. When confidence is low, SOAR briefly widens the search over alternative unmasking decisions to avoid premature commitments; when confidence is high, it collapses the search and decodes many positions in parallel to reduce the number of denoising iterations. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks (GSM8K, MBPP, HumanEval) on Dream-7B and LLaDA-8B, SOAR improves generation quality while maintaining competitive inference speed, offering a practical way to balance quality and efficiency in DLM decoding.

### Computational Phenomenology of Temporal Experience in Autism: Quantifying the Emotional and Narrative Characteristics of Lived Unpredictability
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10947v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10947v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10947v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10947v1)

Disturbances in temporality, such as desynchronization with the social environment and its unpredictability, are considered core features of autism with a deep impact on relationships. However, limitations regarding research on this issue include: 1) the dominance of deficit-based medical models of autism, 2) sample size in qualitative research, and 3) the lack of phenomenological anchoring in computational research. To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the "Immediacy & Suddenness" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction.

### SoftMatcha 2: A Fast and Soft Pattern Matcher for Trillion-Scale Corpora
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10908v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10908v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10908v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10908v1)

We present an ultra-fast and flexible search algorithm that enables search over trillion-scale natural language corpora in under 0.3 seconds while handling semantic variations (substitution, insertion, and deletion). Our approach employs string matching based on suffix arrays that scales well with corpus size. To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025). As a practical application, we demonstrate that our method identifies benchmark contamination in training corpora, unidentified by existing approaches. We also provide an online demo of fast, soft search across corpora in seven languages.

### The CLEF-2026 FinMMEval Lab: Multilingual and Multimodal Evaluation of Financial AI Systems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10886v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10886v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10886v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10886v1)

2026/02/11 14:14 GTM

We present the setup and the tasks of the FinMMEval Lab at CLEF 2026, which introduces the first multilingual and multimodal evaluation framework for financial Large Language Models (LLMs). While recent advances in financial natural language processing have enabled automated analysis of market reports, regulatory documents, and investor communications, existing benchmarks remain largely monolingual, text-only, and limited to narrow subtasks. FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making. Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures models' ability to reason, generalize, and act across diverse languages and modalities. The lab aims to promote the development of robust, transparent, and globally inclusive financial AI systems, with datasets and evaluation resources publicly released to support reproducible research.

### Diagnosing Structural Failures in LLM-Based Evidence Extraction for Meta-Analysis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10881v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10881v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10881v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10881v1)

2026/02/11 14:09 GTM

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses rely on converting narrative articles into structured, numerically grounded study records. Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis. The code and data are publicly available at GitHub (https://github.com/zhiyintan/LLM-Meta-Analysis).

### C-MOP: Integrating Momentum and Boundary-Aware Clustering for Enhanced Prompt Evolution
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10874v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10874v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10874v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10874v1)

Automatic prompt optimization is a promising direction to boost the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods often suffer from noisy and conflicting update signals. In this research, we propose C-MOP (Cluster-based Momentum Optimized Prompting), a framework that stabilizes optimization via Boundary-Aware Contrastive Sampling (BACS) and Momentum-Guided Semantic Clustering (MGSC). Specifically, BACS utilizes batch-level information to mine tripartite features--Hard Negatives, Anchors, and Boundary Pairs--to precisely characterize the typical representation and decision boundaries of positive and negative prompt samples. To resolve semantic conflicts, MGSC introduces a textual momentum mechanism with temporal decay that distills persistent consensus from fluctuating gradients across iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-MOP consistently outperforms SOTA baselines like PromptWizard and ProTeGi, yielding average gains of 1.58% and 3.35%. Notably, C-MOP enables a general LLM with 3B activated parameters to surpass a 70B domain-specific dense LLM, highlighting its effectiveness in driving precise prompt evolution. The code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/C-MOP.

### Training-Induced Bias Toward LLM-Generated Content in Dense Retrieval
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10833v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10833v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10833v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10833v1)

Dense retrieval is a promising approach for acquiring relevant context or world knowledge in open-domain natural language processing tasks and is now widely used in information retrieval applications. However, recent reports claim a broad preference for text generated by large language models (LLMs). This bias is called "source bias", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers.

### I can tell whether you are a Native Hawlêri Speaker! How ANN, CNN, and RNN perform in NLI-Native Language Identification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10832v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10832v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10832v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10832v1)

Native Language Identification (NLI) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that typically determines the native language of an author through their writing or a speaker through their speaking. It has various applications in different areas, such as forensic linguistics and general linguistics studies. Although considerable research has been conducted on NLI regarding two different languages, such as English and German, the literature indicates a significant gap regarding NLI for dialects and subdialects. The gap becomes wider in less-resourced languages such as Kurdish. This research focuses on NLI within the context of a subdialect of Sorani (Central) Kurdish. It aims to investigate the NLI for Hewlêri, a subdialect spoken in Hewlêr (Erbil), the Capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We collected about 24 hours of speech by recording interviews with 40 native or non-native Hewlêri speakers, 17 female and 23 male. We created three Neural Network-based models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which were evaluated through 66 experiments, covering various time-frames from 1 to 60 seconds, undersampling, oversampling, and cross-validation. The RNN model showed the highest accuracy of 95.92% for 5-second audio segmentation, using an 80:10:10 data splitting scheme. The created dataset is the first speech dataset for NLI on the Hewlêri subdialect in the Sorani Kurdish dialect, which can be of benefit to various research areas.

### Beyond Confidence: The Rhythms of Reasoning in Generative Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities yet suffer from sensitivity to slight input context variations, hampering reliability. Conventional metrics like accuracy and perplexity fail to assess local prediction robustness, as normalized output probabilities can obscure the underlying resilience of an LLM's internal state to perturbations. We introduce the Token Constraint Bound ($δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$), a novel metric that quantifies the maximum internal state perturbation an LLM can withstand before its dominant next-token prediction significantly changes. Intrinsically linked to output embedding space geometry, $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ provides insights into the stability of the model's internal predictive commitment. Our experiments show $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ correlates with effective prompt engineering and uncovers critical prediction instabilities missed by perplexity during in-context learning and text generation. $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ offers a principled, complementary approach to analyze and potentially improve the contextual stability of LLM predictions.

### Deep Learning-based Method for Expressing Knowledge Boundary of Black-Box LLM
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10801v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10801v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10801v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10801v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, however, the emergence of content generation distortion (hallucination) limits their practical applications. The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models.

### Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment for Domain-Adaptive VLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10740v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10740v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10740v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10740v1)

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable general-purpose capabilities but often fall short in specialized domains such as medical imaging or geometric problem-solving. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can enhance performance within a target domain, but it typically causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting its generalization. The central challenge, therefore, is to adapt VLMs to new domains while preserving their general-purpose capabilities. Continual pretraining is effective for expanding knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it is less feasible for VLMs due to prohibitive computational costs and the unavailability of pretraining data for most open-source models. This necessitates efficient post-training adaptation methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in preserving general abilities, yet they often fail in domain adaptation scenarios where the model initially lacks sufficient domain knowledge, leading to optimization collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a novel post-training paradigm that introduces a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism. In the early phase, RCPA applies partial output constraints to safely expose the model to new domain concepts. As the model's domain familiarity increases, training gradually transitions to full generation optimization, refining responses and aligning them with domain-specific preferences. This staged adaptation balances domain knowledge acquisition with the preservation of general multimodal capabilities. Extensive experiments across specialized domains and general benchmarks validate the effectiveness of RCPA, establishing a practical pathway toward building high-performing and domain-adaptive VLMs.

### Calliope: A TTS-based Narrated E-book Creator Ensuring Exact Synchronization, Privacy, and Layout Fidelity
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10735v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10735v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10735v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10735v1)

A narrated e-book combines synchronized audio with digital text, highlighting the currently spoken word or sentence during playback. This format supports early literacy and assists individuals with reading challenges, while also allowing general readers to seamlessly switch between reading and listening. With the emergence of natural-sounding neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology, several commercial services have been developed to leverage these technology for converting standard text e-books into high-quality narrated e-books. However, no open-source solutions currently exist to perform this task. In this paper, we present Calliope, an open-source framework designed to fill this gap. Our method leverages state-of-the-art open-source TTS to convert a text e-book into a narrated e-book in the EPUB 3 Media Overlay format. The method offers several innovative steps: audio timestamps are captured directly during TTS, ensuring exact synchronization between narration and text highlighting; the publisher's original typography, styling, and embedded media are strictly preserved; and the entire pipeline operates offline. This offline capability eliminates recurring API costs, mitigates privacy concerns, and avoids copyright compliance issues associated with cloud-based services. The framework currently supports the state-of-the-art open-source TTS systems XTTS-v2 and Chatterbox. A potential alternative approach involves first generating narration via TTS and subsequently synchronizing it with the text using forced alignment. However, while our method ensures exact synchronization, our experiments show that forced alignment introduces drift between the audio and text highlighting significant enough to degrade the reading experience.

### Macaron: Controlled, Human-Written Benchmark for Multilingual and Multicultural Reasoning via Template-Filling

Multilingual benchmarks rarely test reasoning over culturally grounded premises: translated datasets keep English-centric scenarios, while culture-first datasets often lack control over the reasoning required. We propose Macaron, a template-first benchmark that factorizes reasoning type and cultural aspect across question languages. Using 100 language-agnostic templates that cover 7 reasoning types, 22 cultural aspects, native annotators create scenario-aligned English and local-language multiple-choice questions and systematically derived True/False questions. Macaron contains 11,862 instances spanning 20 countries/cultural contexts, 10 scripts, and 20 languages (including low-resource ones like Amharic, Yoruba, Zulu, Kyrgyz, and some Arabic dialects). In zero-shot evaluation of 21 multilingual LLMs, reasoning-mode models achieve the strongest performance and near-parity between English and local languages, while open-weight models degrade substantially in local languages and often approach chance on T/F tasks. Culture-grounded mathematical and counting templates are consistently the hardest. The data can be accessed here https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlaaAhmed2444/Macaron.

### SnapMLA: Efficient Long-Context MLA Decoding via Hardware-Aware FP8 Quantized Pipelining

While FP8 attention has shown substantial promise in innovations like FlashAttention-3, its integration into the decoding phase of the DeepSeek Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) architecture presents notable challenges. These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

### RE-LLM: Refining Empathetic Speech-LLM Responses by Integrating Emotion Nuance

With generative AI advancing, empathy in human-AI interaction is essential. While prior work focuses on emotional reflection, emotional exploration, key to deeper engagement, remains overlooked. Existing LLMs rely on text which captures limited emotion nuances. To address this, we propose RE-LLM, a speech-LLM integrating dimensional emotion embeddings and auxiliary learning. Experiments show statistically significant gains in empathy metrics across three datasets. RE-LLM relatively improves the Emotional Reaction score by 14.79% and 6.76% compared to text-only and speech-LLM baselines on ESD. Notably, it raises the Exploration score by 35.42% and 3.91% on IEMOCAP, 139.28% and 9.83% on ESD, and 60.95% and 22.64% on MSP-PODCAST. It also boosts unweighted accuracy by 5.4% on IEMOCAP, 2.3% on ESD, and 6.9% on MSP-PODCAST in speech emotion recognition. These results highlight the enriched emotional understanding and improved empathetic response generation of RE-LLM.

### Locomo-Plus: Beyond-Factual Cognitive Memory Evaluation Framework for LLM Agents

Long-term conversational memory is a core capability for LLM-based dialogue systems, yet existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols primarily focus on surface-level factual recall. In realistic interactions, appropriate responses often depend on implicit constraints such as user state, goals, or values that are not explicitly queried later. To evaluate this setting, we introduce \textbf{LoCoMo-Plus}, a benchmark for assessing cognitive memory under cue--trigger semantic disconnect, where models must retain and apply latent constraints across long conversational contexts. We further show that conventional string-matching metrics and explicit task-type prompting are misaligned with such scenarios, and propose a unified evaluation framework based on constraint consistency. Experiments across diverse backbone models, retrieval-based methods, and memory systems demonstrate that cognitive memory remains challenging and reveals failures not captured by existing benchmarks.

### Targeted Syntactic Evaluation of Language Models on Georgian Case Alignment

This paper evaluates the performance of transformer-based language models on split-ergative case alignment in Georgian, a particularly rare system for assigning grammatical cases to mark argument roles. We focus on subject and object marking determined through various permutations of nominative, ergative, and dative noun forms. A treebank-based approach for the generation of minimal pairs using the Grew query language is implemented. We create a dataset of 370 syntactic tests made up of seven tasks containing 50-70 samples each, where three noun forms are tested in any given sample. Five encoder- and two decoder-only models are evaluated with word- and/or sentence-level accuracy metrics. Regardless of the specific syntactic makeup, models performed worst in assigning the ergative case correctly and strongest in assigning the nominative case correctly. Performance correlated with the overall frequency distribution of the three forms (NOM > DAT > ERG). Though data scarcity is a known issue for low-resource languages, we show that the highly specific role of the ergative along with a lack of available training data likely contributes to poor performance on this case. The dataset is made publicly available and the methodology provides an interesting avenue for future syntactic evaluations of languages where benchmarks are limited.

### Benchmarks Are Not That Out of Distribution: Word Overlap Predicts Performance

Understanding what constitutes high-quality pre-training data remains a central question in language model training. In this work, we investigate whether benchmark performance is primarily driven by the degree of statistical pattern overlap between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets. We measure this overlap using word-level unigram cross-entropy and word frequency statistics, and perform controlled experiments across $10$ zero-shot benchmarks, $4$ pre-training datasets spanning $8.5\mathrm{B}$ to $60\mathrm{B}$ tokens, and model sizes ranging from $400\mathrm{M}$ to $3\mathrm{B}$ parameters. Our results demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between word-level unigram cross-entropy and benchmark performance, suggesting that widely used benchmarks are strongly influenced by word overlap between training and evaluation data. Thus, larger pre-training subsets with similar word-level unigram cross-entropy yield improved downstream results, indicating that word frequency statistics play an additional role in shaping benchmark scores. Taken together, these results suggest that many standard benchmarks are only weakly out-of-distribution relative to pre-training corpora, so that simple word-overlap statistics predict benchmark performance.

### UMEM: Unified Memory Extraction and Management Framework for Generalizable Memory

Self-evolving memory serves as the trainable parameters for Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents, where extraction (distilling insights from experience) and management (updating the memory bank) must be tightly coordinated. Existing methods predominately optimize memory management while treating memory extraction as a static process, resulting in poor generalization, where agents accumulate instance-specific noise rather than robust memories. To address this, we propose Unified Memory Extraction and Management (UMEM), a self-evolving agent framework that jointly optimizes a Large Language Model to simultaneous extract and manage memories. To mitigate overfitting to specific instances, we introduce Semantic Neighborhood Modeling and optimize the model with a neighborhood-level marginal utility reward via GRPO. This approach ensures memory generalizability by evaluating memory utility across clusters of semantically related queries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate that UMEM significantly outperforms highly competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.67% improvement in multi-turn interactive tasks. Futhermore, UMEM maintains a monotonic growth curve during continuous evolution. Codes and models will be publicly released.

### To Think or Not To Think, That is The Question for Large Reasoning Models in Theory of Mind Tasks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10625v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10625v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10625v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10625v1)

Theory of Mind (ToM) assesses whether models can infer hidden mental states such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, which is essential for natural social interaction. Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods.

### How Do Decoder-Only LLMs Perceive Users? Rethinking Attention Masking for User Representation Learning

Decoder-only large language models are increasingly used as behavioral encoders for user representation learning, yet the impact of attention masking on the quality of user embeddings remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of causal, hybrid, and bidirectional attention masks within a unified contrastive learning framework trained on large-scale real-world Alipay data that integrates long-horizon heterogeneous user behaviors. To improve training dynamics when transitioning from causal to bidirectional attention, we propose Gradient-Guided Soft Masking, a gradient-based pre-warmup applied before a linear scheduler that gradually opens future attention during optimization. Evaluated on 9 industrial user cognition benchmarks covering prediction, preference, and marketing sensitivity tasks, our approach consistently yields more stable training and higher-quality bidirectional representations compared with causal, hybrid, and scheduler-only baselines, while remaining compatible with decoder pretraining. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of masking design and training transition in adapting decoder-only LLMs for effective user representation learning.

### ISD-Agent-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Instructional Design Agents

Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown promising potential in automating Instructional Systems Design (ISD), a systematic approach to developing educational programs. However, evaluating these agents remains challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks and the risk of LLM-as-judge bias. We present ISD-Agent-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 25,795 scenarios generated via a Context Matrix framework that combines 51 contextual variables across 5 categories with 33 ISD sub-steps derived from the ADDIE model. To ensure evaluation reliability, we employ a multi-judge protocol using diverse LLMs from different providers, achieving high inter-judge reliability. We compare existing ISD agents with novel agents grounded in classical ISD theories such as ADDIE, Dick \& Carey, and Rapid Prototyping ISD. Experiments on 1,017 test scenarios demonstrate that integrating classical ISD frameworks with modern ReAct-style reasoning achieves the highest performance, outperforming both pure theory-based agents and technique-only approaches. Further analysis reveals that theoretical quality strongly correlates with benchmark performance, with theory-based agents showing significant advantages in problem-centered design and objective-assessment alignment. Our work provides a foundation for systematic LLM-based ISD research.

### Online Causal Kalman Filtering for Stable and Effective Policy Optimization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10609v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10609v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10609v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10609v1)

Reinforcement learning for large language models suffers from high-variance token-level importance sampling (IS) ratios, which would destabilize policy optimization at scale. To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates. Experimentally, KPO achieves superior results on challenging math reasoning datasets compared with state-of-the-art counterparts.

### Step 3.5 Flash: Open Frontier-Level Intelligence with 11B Active Parameters
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10604v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10604v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10604v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10604v1)

2026/02/11 07:53 GTM

We introduce Step 3.5 Flash, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model that bridges frontier-level agentic intelligence and computational efficiency. We focus on what matters most when building agents: sharp reasoning and fast, reliable execution. Step 3.5 Flash pairs a 196B-parameter foundation with 11B active parameters for efficient inference. It is optimized with interleaved 3:1 sliding-window/full attention and Multi-Token Prediction (MTP-3) to reduce the latency and cost of multi-round agentic interactions. To reach frontier-level intelligence, we design a scalable reinforcement learning framework that combines verifiable signals with preference feedback, while remaining stable under large-scale off-policy training, enabling consistent self-improvement across mathematics, code, and tool use. Step 3.5 Flash demonstrates strong performance across agent, coding, and math tasks, achieving 85.4% on IMO-AnswerBench, 86.4% on LiveCodeBench-v6 (2024.08-2025.05), 88.2% on tau2-Bench, 69.0% on BrowseComp (with context management), and 51.0% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, comparable to frontier models such as GPT-5.2 xHigh and Gemini 3.0 Pro. By redefining the efficiency frontier, Step 3.5 Flash provides a high-density foundation for deploying sophisticated agents in real-world industrial environments.

### When to Memorize and When to Stop: Gated Recurrent Memory for Long-Context Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10560v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10560v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10560v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10560v1)

While reasoning over long context is crucial for various real-world applications, it remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) as they suffer from performance degradation as the context length grows. Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals $r^{\text{update}}$ and $r^{\text{exit}}$ within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively. Experiments on various long-context reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GRU-Mem, which generally outperforms the vanilla MemAgent with up to 400\% times inference speed acceleration.

### YOR: Your Own Mobile Manipulator for Generalizable Robotics

Recent advances in robot learning have generated significant interest in capable platforms that may eventually approach human-level competence. This interest, combined with the commoditization of actuators, has propelled growth in low-cost robotic platforms. However, the optimal form factor for mobile manipulation, especially on a budget, remains an open question. We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation. Our design emphasizes modularity, ease of assembly using off-the-shelf components, and affordability, with a bill-of-materials cost under 10,000 USD. We demonstrate YOR's capability by completing tasks that require coordinated whole-body control, bimanual manipulation, and autonomous navigation. Overall, YOR offers competitive functionality for mobile manipulation research at a fraction of the cost of existing platforms. Project website: https://www.yourownrobot.ai/

### APEX: Learning Adaptive High-Platform Traversal for Humanoid Robots

Humanoid locomotion has advanced rapidly with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling robust feet-based traversal over uneven terrain. Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands. Experiments on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (approximately 114% of leg length), with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, as well as smooth and stable multi-skill transitions.

### Data-Efficient Hierarchical Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning via Normalizing Flows
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11142v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11142v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11142v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11142v1)

Hierarchical goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (H-GCRL) provides a powerful framework for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into structured subgoals. However, its practical adoption is hindered by poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline or data-scarce regimes. In this work, Normalizing flow-based hierarchical implicit Q-learning (NF-HIQL), a novel framework that replaces unimodal gaussian policies with expressive normalizing flow policies at both the high- and low-levels of the hierarchy is introduced. This design enables tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and the ability to model rich multimodal behaviors. New theoretical guarantees are derived, including explicit KL-divergence bounds for Real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) policies and PAC-style sample efficiency results, showing that NF-HIQL preserves stability while improving generalization. Empirically, NF-HIQL is evaluted across diverse long-horizon tasks in locomotion, ball-dribbling, and multi-step manipulation from OGBench. NF-HIQL consistently outperforms prior goal-conditioned and hierarchical baselines, demonstrating superior robustness under limited data and highlighting the potential of flow-based architectures for scalable, data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning.

### Min-Sum Uniform Coverage Problem by Autonomous Mobile Robots

We study the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem for a swarm of $n$ mobile robots on a given finite line segment and on a circle having finite positive radius, where the circle is given as an input. The robots must coordinate their movements to reach a uniformly spaced configuration that minimizes the total distance traveled by all robots. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, identical, and homogeneous, and operate under the \textit{Look-Compute-Move} (LCM) model with \textit{non-rigid} motion controlled by a fair asynchronous scheduler. They are oblivious and silent, possessing neither persistent memory nor a means of explicit communication. In the \textbf{line-segment setting}, the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem requires placing the robots at uniformly spaced points along the segment so as to minimize the total distance traveled by all robots. In the \textbf{circle setting} for this problem, the robots have to arrange themselves uniformly around the given circle to form a regular $n$-gon. There is no fixed orientation or designated starting vertex, and the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots. We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage in the line-segment setting with minimum total movement cost. For the circle setting, we characterize all initial configurations for which the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem is deterministically unsolvable under the considered robot model. For all the other remaining configurations, we provide a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage while minimizing the total distance traveled. These results characterize the deterministic solvability of min-sum coverage for oblivious robots and achieve optimal cost whenever solvable.

### Multi-UAV Trajectory Optimization for Bearing-Only Localization in GPS Denied Environments

Accurate localization of maritime targets by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remains challenging in GPS-denied environments. UAVs equipped with gimballed electro-optical sensors are typically used to localize targets, however, reliance on these sensors increases mechanical complexity, cost, and susceptibility to single-point failures, limiting scalability and robustness in multi-UAV operations. This work presents a new trajectory optimization framework that enables cooperative target localization using UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras operating in coordination with a surface vessel. This estimation-aware optimization generates dynamically feasible trajectories that explicitly account for mission constraints, platform dynamics, and out-of-frame events. Estimation-aware trajectories outperform heuristic paths by reducing localization error by more than a factor of two, motivating their use in cooperative operations. Results further demonstrate that coordinated UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras achieve localization accuracy that meets or exceeds that of single gimballed systems, while substantially lowering system complexity and cost, enabling scalability, and enhancing mission resilience.

### A receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner for legged robots in challenging environments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11113v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11113v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11113v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11113v1)

2026/02/11 18:25 GTM

We present a novel receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner for legged robots in challenging scenarios, able to plan motions such as chimney climbing, navigating very narrow passages or crossing large gaps. Our approach adds new capabilities to the state of the art, including the ability to reactively re-plan in response to new information, and planning contact locations and whole-body trajectories simultaneously, simplifying the implementation and removing the need for post-processing or complex multi-stage approaches. Our method is more resistant to local minima problems than other potential field based approaches, and our quadratic-program-based posture generator returns nodes more quickly than those of existing algorithms. Rigorous statistical analysis shows that, with short planning horizons (e.g., one step ahead), our planner is faster than the state-of-the-art across all scenarios tested (between 45% and 98% faster on average, depending on the scenario), while planning less efficient motions (requiring 5% fewer to 700% more stance changes on average). In all but one scenario (Chimney Walking), longer planning horizons (e.g., four steps ahead) extended the average planning times (between 73% faster and 400% slower than the state-of-the-art) but resulted in higher quality motion plans (between 8% more and 47% fewer stance changes than the state-of-the-art).

### Digging for Data: Experiments in Rock Pile Characterization Using Only Proprioceptive Sensing in Excavation

Characterization of fragmented rock piles is a fundamental task in the mining and quarrying industries, where rock is fragmented by blasting, transported using wheel loaders, and then sent for further processing. This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator's inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry. The relative particle size estimates generated with the proposed sensing methodology are compared with those obtained from both a vision-based fragmentation analysis tool and from sieving of sampled materials.

### RISE: Self-Improving Robot Policy with Compositional World Model

Despite the sustained scaling on model capacity and data acquisition, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks, where minor execution deviations can compound into failures. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.

### SQ-CBF: Signed Distance Functions for Numerically Stable Superquadric-Based Safety Filtering
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11049v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11049v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11049v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11049v1)

Ensuring safe robot operation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge. While control barrier functions provide an effective framework for real-time safety filtering, their performance critically depends on the underlying geometric representation, which is often simplified, leading to either overly conservative behavior or insufficient collision coverage. Superquadrics offer an expressive way to model complex shapes using a few primitives and are increasingly used for robot safety. To integrate this representation into collision avoidance, most existing approaches directly use their implicit functions as barrier candidates. However, we identify a critical but overlooked issue in this practice: the gradients of the implicit SQ function can become severely ill-conditioned, potentially rendering the optimization infeasible and undermining reliable real-time safety filtering. To address this issue, we formulate an SQ-based safety filtering framework that uses signed distance functions as barrier candidates. Since analytical SDFs are unavailable for general SQs, we compute distances using the efficient Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm and obtain gradients via randomized smoothing. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate consistent collision-free manipulation in cluttered and unstructured scenes, showing robustness to challenging geometries, sensing noise, and dynamic disturbances, while improving task efficiency in teleoperation tasks. These results highlight a pathway toward safety filters that remain precise and reliable under the geometric complexity of real-world environments.

### ContactGaussian-WM: Learning Physics-Grounded World Model from Videos

Developing world models that understand complex physical interactions is essential for advancing robotic planning and simulation.However, existing methods often struggle to accurately model the environment under conditions of data scarcity and complex contact-rich dynamic motion.To address these challenges, we propose ContactGaussian-WM, a differentiable physics-grounded rigid-body world model capable of learning intricate physical laws directly from sparse and contact-rich video sequences.Our framework consists of two core components: (1) a unified Gaussian representation for both visual appearance and collision geometry, and (2) an end-to-end differentiable learning framework that differentiates through a closed-form physics engine to infer physical properties from sparse visual observations.Extensive simulations and real-world evaluations demonstrate that ContactGaussian-WM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in learning complex scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.Furthermore, we showcase the practical utility of our framework in downstream applications, including data synthesis and real-time MPC.

### Enhancing Predictability of Multi-Tenant DNN Inference for Autonomous Vehicles' Perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11004v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11004v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11004v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11004v1)

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.

### Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning of Drone Aerobatics by Exploiting Geometric Symmetries

Flight control for autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) is evolving from steady flight near equilibrium points toward more aggressive aerobatic maneuvers, such as flips, rolls, and Power Loop. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in these tasks, conventional RL methods often suffer from low data efficiency and limited generalization. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-task scenarios where a single policy is required to master multiple maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task reinforcement learning framework, called GEAR (Geometric Equivariant Aerobatics Reinforcement), which fully exploits the inherent SO(2) rotational symmetry in MAV dynamics and explicitly incorporates this property into the policy network architecture. By integrating an equivariant actor network, FiLM-based task modulation, and a multi-head critic, GEAR achieves both efficiency and flexibility in learning diverse aerobatic maneuvers, enabling a data-efficient, robust, and unified framework for aerobatic control. GEAR attains a 98.85\% success rate across various aerobatic tasks, significantly outperforming baseline methods. In real-world experiments, GEAR demonstrates stable execution of multiple maneuvers and the capability to combine basic motion primitives to complete complex aerobatics.

### Scaling World Model for Hierarchical Manipulation Policies

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

### RADAR: Benchmarking Vision-Language-Action Generalization via Real-World Dynamics, Spatial-Physical Intelligence, and Autonomous Evaluation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10980v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10980v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10980v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10980v1)

VLA models have achieved remarkable progress in embodied intelligence; however, their evaluation remains largely confined to simulations or highly constrained real-world settings. This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.

### Lie Group Variational Integrator for the Geometrically Exact Rod with Circular Cross-Section Incorporating Cross-Sectional Deformation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10963v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10963v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10963v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10963v1)

2026/02/11 15:54 GTM

In this paper, we derive the continuous space-time equations of motion of a three-dimensional geometrically exact rod, or the Cosserat rod, incorporating planar cross-sectional deformation. We then adopt the Lie group variational integrator technique to obtain a discrete model of the rod incorporating both rotational motion and cross-sectional deformation as well. The resulting discrete model possesses several desirable features: it ensures volume conservation of the discrete elements by considering cross-sectional deformation through a local dilatation factor, it demonstrates the beneficial properties associated with the variational integrator technique, such as the preservation of the rotational configuration, and energy conservation with a bounded error. An exhaustive set of numerical results under various initial conditions of the rod demonstrates the efficacy of the model in replicating the physics of the system.

### Stability Analysis of Geometric Control for a Canonical Class of Underactuated Aerial Vehicles with Spurious Forces
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10961v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10961v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10961v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10961v1)

Standard geometric control relies on force-moment decoupling, an assumption that breaks down in many aerial platforms due to spurious forces naturally induced by control moments. While strategies for such coupled systems have been validated experimentally, a rigorous theoretical certification of their stability is currently missing. This work fills this gap by providing the first formal stability analysis for a generic class of floating rigid bodies subject to spurious forces. We introduce a canonical model and construct a Lyapunov-based proof establishing local exponential stability of the hovering equilibrium. Crucially, the analysis explicitly addresses the structural challenges - specifically the induced non-minimum-phase behavior - that prevent the application of standard cascade arguments.

### Developing Neural Network-Based Gaze Control Systems for Social Robots
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10946v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10946v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10946v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10946v1)

2026/02/11 15:30 GTM

During multi-party interactions, gaze direction is a key indicator of interest and intent, making it essential for social robots to direct their attention appropriately. Understanding the social context is crucial for robots to engage effectively, predict human intentions, and navigate interactions smoothly. This study aims to develop an empirical motion-time pattern for human gaze behavior in various social situations (e.g., entering, leaving, waving, talking, and pointing) using deep neural networks based on participants' data. We created two video clips-one for a computer screen and another for a virtual reality headset-depicting different social scenarios. Data were collected from 30 participants: 15 using an eye-tracker and 15 using an Oculus Quest 1 headset. Deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, were used to analyze and predict gaze patterns. Our models achieved 60% accuracy in predicting gaze direction in a 2D animation and 65% accuracy in a 3D animation. Then, the best model was implemented onto the Nao robot; and 36 new participants evaluated its performance. The feedback indicated overall satisfaction, with those experienced in robotics rating the models more favorably.

### Towards Learning a Generalizable 3D Scene Representation from 2D Observations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10943v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10943v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10943v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10943v1)

2026/02/11 15:22 GTM

We introduce a Generalizable Neural Radiance Field approach for predicting 3D workspace occupancy from egocentric robot observations. Unlike prior methods operating in camera-centric coordinates, our model constructs occupancy representations in a global workspace frame, making it directly applicable to robotic manipulation. The model integrates flexible source views and generalizes to unseen object arrangements without scene-specific finetuning. We demonstrate the approach on a humanoid robot and evaluate predicted geometry against 3D sensor ground truth. Trained on 40 real scenes, our model achieves 26mm reconstruction error, including occluded regions, validating its ability to infer complete 3D occupancy beyond traditional stereo vision methods.

### Design, Development, and Use of Maya Robot as an Assistant for the Therapy/Education of Children with Cancer: a Pilot Study
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10942v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10942v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10942v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10942v1)

This study centers around the design and implementation of the Maya Robot, a portable elephant-shaped social robot, intended to engage with children undergoing cancer treatment. Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value < 0.05). This preliminary exploratory study highlights the positive impact of utilizing Maya as an assistant for therapy/education in a clinical setting, particularly benefiting children undergoing cancer treatment. The findings underscore the potential of social robots in pediatric healthcare contexts, emphasizing improved pain management and emotional well-being among young patients.

### Safe mobility support system using crowd mapping and avoidance route planning using VLM

Autonomous mobile robots offer promising solutions for labor shortages and increased operational efficiency. However, navigating safely and effectively in dynamic environments, particularly crowded areas, remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to generate dynamic crowd-density maps (``Abstraction Maps'') for autonomous robot navigation. Our approach utilizes VLM's capability to recognize abstract environmental concepts, such as crowd densities, and represents them probabilistically via GPR. Experimental results from real-world trials on a university campus demonstrated that robots successfully generated routes avoiding both static obstacles and dynamic crowds, enhancing navigation safety and adaptability.

### Biomimetic Mantaray robot toward the underwater autonomous -- Experimental verification of swimming and diving by flapping motion -

This study presents the development and experimental verification of a biomimetic manta ray robot for underwater autonomous exploration. Inspired by manta rays, the robot uses flapping motion for propulsion to minimize seabed disturbance and enhance efficiency compared to traditional screw propulsion. The robot features pectoral fins driven by servo motors and a streamlined control box to reduce fluid resistance. The control system, powered by a Raspberry Pi 3B, includes an IMU and pressure sensor for real-time monitoring and control. Experiments in a pool assessed the robot's swimming and diving capabilities. Results show stable swimming and diving motions with PD control. The robot is suitable for applications in environments like aquariums and fish nurseries, requiring minimal disturbance and efficient maneuverability. Our findings demonstrate the potential of bio-inspired robotic designs to improve ecological monitoring and underwater exploration.

### Semi-Supervised Cross-Domain Imitation Learning

Cross-domain imitation learning (CDIL) accelerates policy learning by transferring expert knowledge across domains, which is valuable in applications where the collection of expert data is costly. Existing methods are either supervised, relying on proxy tasks and explicit alignment, or unsupervised, aligning distributions without paired data, but often unstable. We introduce the Semi-Supervised CDIL (SS-CDIL) setting and propose the first algorithm for SS-CDIL with theoretical justification. Our method uses only offline data, including a small number of target expert demonstrations and some unlabeled imperfect trajectories. To handle domain discrepancy, we propose a novel cross-domain loss function for learning inter-domain state-action mappings and design an adaptive weight function to balance the source and target knowledge. Experiments on MuJoCo and Robosuite show consistent gains over the baselines, demonstrating that our approach achieves stable and data-efficient policy learning with minimal supervision. Our code is available at~ https://github.com/NYCU-RL-Bandits-Lab/CDIL.

### From Steering to Pedalling: Do Autonomous Driving VLMs Generalize to Cyclist-Assistive Spatial Perception and Planning?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10771v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10771v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10771v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10771v1)

Cyclists often encounter safety-critical situations in urban traffic, highlighting the need for assistive systems that support safe and informed decision-making. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.

### From Representational Complementarity to Dual Systems: Synergizing VLM and Vision-Only Backbones for End-to-End Driving
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10719v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10719v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10719v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10719v1)

2026/02/11 10:25 GTM

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) driving augments end-to-end (E2E) planning with language-enabled backbones, yet it remains unclear what changes beyond the usual accuracy--cost trade-off. We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x. Code will be released.

### Say, Dream, and Act: Learning Video World Models for Instruction-Driven Robot Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10717v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10717v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10717v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10717v1)

Robotic manipulation requires anticipating how the environment evolves in response to actions, yet most existing systems lack this predictive capability, often resulting in errors and inefficiency. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide high-level guidance, they cannot explicitly forecast future states, and existing world models either predict only short horizons or produce spatially inconsistent frames. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines. Codes & Models will be released.

### (MGS)$^2$-Net: Unifying Micro-Geometric Scale and Macro-Geometric Structure for Cross-View Geo-Localization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10704v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10704v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10704v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10704v1)

2026/02/11 10:03 GTM

Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\% on University-1652 and 97.02\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity. The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/GabrielLi1473/MGS-Net}{https://github.com/GabrielLi1473/MGS-Net}.

### Omnidirectional Dual-Arm Aerial Manipulator with Proprioceptive Contact Localization for Landing on Slanted Roofs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10703v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10703v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10703v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10703v1)

Operating drones in urban environments often means they need to land on rooftops, which can have different geometries and surface irregularities. Accurately detecting roof inclination using conventional sensing methods, such as vision-based or acoustic techniques, can be unreliable, as measurement quality is strongly influenced by external factors including weather conditions and surface materials. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unmanned aerial manipulator morphology featuring a dual-arm aerial manipulator with an omnidirectional 3D workspace and extended reach. Building on this design, we develop a proprioceptive contact detection and contact localization strategy based on a momentum-based torque observer. This enables the UAM to infer the inclination of slanted surfaces blindly - through physical interaction - prior to touchdown. We validate the approach in flight experiments, demonstrating robust landings on surfaces with inclinations of up to 30.5 degrees and achieving an average surface inclination estimation error of 2.87 degrees over 9 experiments at different incline angles.

### A Unified Experimental Architecture for Informative Path Planning: from Simulation to Deployment with GuadalPlanner
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10702v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10702v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10702v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10702v1)

2026/02/11 10:02 GTM

The evaluation of informative path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles is often hindered by fragmented execution pipelines and limited transferability between simulation and real-world deployment. This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification. The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline. The approach is validated through a set of experiments, including real-world deployment on an autonomous surface vehicle performing water quality monitoring with real-time sensor feedback.

### 3D-Printed Anisotropic Soft Magnetic Coating for Directional Rolling of a Magnetically Actuated Capsule Robot
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10688v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10688v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10688v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10688v1)

Capsule robots are promising tools for minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy, with applications from gastrointestinal endoscopy to targeted drug delivery and biopsy sampling. Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing the usable cavity by about 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. We propose a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets, enabling locomotion via a thin, functional shell while preserving the entire interior cavity as a continuous volume for medical payloads. The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability. Together, these advances aim to transition coating-based capsule robots toward reliable clinical deployment and broaden their applications in minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy.

Despite the different origins and design philosophies, the development and operations of these platforms encountered various convergences. Hence, this paper presents a detailed overview of these robots, presenting their objectives, design, and onboard operations. Hence, joint lessons learned across the lifecycle are presented, from design to on-orbit operations. These lessons learned are anticipated to serve for future development and research as design recommendations.

Autonomous Underwater Robots (AURs) operate in challenging underwater environments, including low visibility and harsh water conditions. Such conditions present challenges for software engineers developing perception modules for the AUR software. To successfully carry out these tasks, deep learning has been incorporated into the AUR software to support its operations. However, the unique challenges of underwater environments pose difficulties for deep learning models, which often rely on labeled data that is scarce and noisy. This may undermine the trustworthiness of AUR software that relies on perception modules. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for AUR software as they generalize to unseen objects and remain robust in noisy conditions by inferring information from contextual cues. Despite this potential, their performance and uncertainty in underwater environments remain understudied from a software engineering perspective. Motivated by the needs of an industrial partner in assurance and risk management for maritime systems to assess the potential use of VLMs in this context, we present an empirical evaluation of VLM-based perception modules within the AUR software. We assess their ability to detect underwater trash by computing performance, uncertainty, and their relationship, to enable software engineers to select appropriate VLMs for their AUR software.

### Pitch Angle Control of a Magnetically Actuated Capsule Robot with Nonlinear FEA-based MPC and EKF Multisensory Fusion

Magnetically actuated capsule robots promise minimally invasive diagnosis and therapy in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but existing systems largely neglect control of capsule pitch, a degree of freedom critical for contact-rich interaction with inclined gastric walls. This paper presents a nonlinear, model-based framework for magnetic pitch control of an ingestible capsule robot actuated by a four-coil electromagnetic array. Angle-dependent magnetic forces and torques acting on embedded permanent magnets are characterized using three-dimensional finite-element simulations and embedded as lookup tables in a control-oriented rigid-body pitching model with rolling contact and actuator dynamics. A constrained model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to regulate pitch while respecting hardware-imposed current and slew-rate limits. Experiments on a compliant stomach-inspired surface demonstrate robust pitch reorientation from both horizontal and upright configurations, achieving about three to five times faster settling and reduced oscillatory motion than on-off control. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements enables stable closed-loop control when the camera update rate is reduced from 30 Hz to 1 Hz, emulating clinically realistic imaging constraints. These results establish finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion as a scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-degree-of-freedom capsule locomotion.

Imitation Learning (IL) enables robots to learn complex skills from demonstrations without explicit task modeling, but it typically requires large amounts of demonstrations, creating significant collection costs. Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.

This paper presents a closed-loop automation framework for heterogeneous modular robots, covering the full pipeline from morphological construction to adaptive control. In this framework, a mobile manipulator handles heterogeneous functional modules including structural, joint, and wheeled modules to dynamically assemble diverse robot configurations and provide them with immediate locomotion capability. To address the state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration, we propose a hierarchical planner: the high-level planner uses a bidirectional heuristic search with type-penalty terms to generate module-handling sequences, while the low level planner employs A* search to compute optimal execution trajectories. This design effectively decouples discrete configuration planning from continuous motion execution. For adaptive motion generation of unknown assembled configurations, we introduce a GPU accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. By incorporating a multi stage variance annealing strategy to balance global exploration and local convergence, the controller enables configuration-agnostic, real-time motion control. Large scale simulations show that the type-penalty term is critical for planning robustness in heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the greedy heuristic produces plans with lower physical execution costs than the Hungarian heuristic. The proposed annealing-variance MPPI significantly outperforms standard MPPI in both velocity tracking accuracy and control frequency, achieving real time control at 50 Hz. The framework validates the full-cycle process, including module assembly, robot merging and splitting, and dynamic motion generation.

A long-standing goal in robotics is a generalist policy that can be deployed zero-shot on new robot embodiments without per-embodiment adaptation. Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.

### An Ontology-driven Dynamic Knowledge Base for Uninhabited Ground Vehicles

In this paper, the concept of Dynamic Contextual Mission Data (DCMD) is introduced to develop an ontology-driven dynamic knowledge base for Uninhabited Ground Vehicles (UGVs) at the tactical edge. The dynamic knowledge base with DCMD is added to the UGVs to: support enhanced situation awareness; improve autonomous decision making; and facilitate agility within complex and dynamic environments. As UGVs are heavily reliant on the a priori information added pre-mission, unexpected occurrences during a mission can cause identification ambiguities and require increased levels of user input. Updating this a priori information with contextual information can help UGVs realise their full potential. To address this, the dynamic knowledge base was designed using an ontology-driven representation, supported by near real-time information acquisition and analysis, to provide in-mission on-platform DCMD updates. This was implemented on a team of four UGVs that executed a laboratory based surveillance mission. The results showed that the ontology-driven dynamic representation of the UGV operational environment was machine actionable, producing contextual information to support a successful and timely mission, and contributed directly to the situation awareness.
