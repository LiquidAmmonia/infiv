### Stroke of Surprise: Progressive Semantic Illusions in Vector Sketching
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12280v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12280v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12280v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12280v1)

Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the "dual-constraint": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a "common structural subspace" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

### UniT: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Test-time Scaling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12279v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12279v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12279v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12279v1)

Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.

### MonarchRT: Efficient Attention for Real-Time Video Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12271v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12271v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12271v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12271v1)

Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.

### Energy-Aware Spike Budgeting for Continual Learning in Spiking Neural Networks for Neuromorphic Vision
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12236v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12236v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12236v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12236v1)

2026/02/12 18:15 GTM

Neuromorphic vision systems based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer ultra-low-power perception for event-based and frame-based cameras, yet catastrophic forgetting remains a critical barrier to deployment in continually evolving environments. Existing continual learning methods, developed primarily for artificial neural networks, seldom jointly optimize accuracy and energy efficiency, with particularly limited exploration on event-based datasets. We propose an energy-aware spike budgeting framework for continual SNN learning that integrates experience replay, learnable leaky integrate-and-fire neuron parameters, and an adaptive spike scheduler to enforce dataset-specific energy constraints during training. Our approach exhibits modality-dependent behavior: on frame-based datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10), spike budgeting acts as a sparsity-inducing regularizer, improving accuracy while reducing spike rates by up to 47\%; on event-based datasets (DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST, CIFAR-10-DVS), controlled budget relaxation enables accuracy gains up to 17.45 percentage points with minimal computational overhead. Across five benchmarks spanning both modalities, our method demonstrates consistent performance improvements while minimizing dynamic power consumption, advancing the practical viability of continual learning in neuromorphic vision systems.

### Towards On-Policy SFT: Distribution Discriminant Theory and its Applications in LLM Training
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12222v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12222v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12222v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12222v1)

2026/02/12 17:59 GTM

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is computationally efficient but often yields inferior generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). This gap is primarily driven by RL's use of on-policy data. We propose a framework to bridge this chasm by enabling On-Policy SFT. We first present \textbf{\textit{Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT)}}, which explains and quantifies the alignment between data and the model-induced distribution. Leveraging DDT, we introduce two complementary techniques: (i) \textbf{\textit{In-Distribution Finetuning (IDFT)}}, a loss-level method to enhance generalization ability of SFT, and (ii) \textbf{\textit{Hinted Decoding}}, a data-level technique that can re-align the training corpus to the model's distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves generalization performance on par with prominent offline RL algorithms, including DPO and SimPO, while maintaining the efficiency of an SFT pipeline. The proposed framework thus offers a practical alternative in domains where RL is infeasible. We open-source the code here: https://github.com/zhangmiaosen2000/Towards-On-Policy-SFT

### Best of Both Worlds: Multimodal Reasoning and Generation via Unified Discrete Flow Matching
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12221v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12221v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12221v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12221v1)

2026/02/12 17:59 GTM

We propose UniDFlow, a unified discrete flow-matching framework for multimodal understanding, generation, and editing. It decouples understanding and generation via task-specific low-rank adapters, avoiding objective interference and representation entanglement, while a novel reference-based multimodal preference alignment optimizes relative outcomes under identical conditioning, improving faithfulness and controllability without large-scale retraining. UniDFlpw achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to tasks including inpainting, in-context image generation, reference-based editing, and compositional generation, despite no explicit task-specific training.

### DeepGen 1.0: A Lightweight Unified Multimodal Model for Advancing Image Generation and Editing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12205v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12205v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12205v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12205v1)

2026/02/12 17:44 GTM

Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

### EO-VAE: Towards A Multi-sensor Tokenizer for Earth Observation Data
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12177v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12177v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12177v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12177v1)

2026/02/12 17:09 GTM

State-of-the-art generative image and video models rely heavily on tokenizers that compress high-dimensional inputs into more efficient latent representations. While this paradigm has revolutionized RGB generation, Earth observation (EO) data presents unique challenges due to diverse sensor specifications and variable spectral channels. We propose EO-VAE, a multi-sensor variational autoencoder designed to serve as a foundational tokenizer for the EO domain. Unlike prior approaches that train separate tokenizers for each modality, EO-VAE utilizes a single model to encode and reconstruct flexible channel combinations via dynamic hypernetworks. Our experiments on the TerraMesh dataset demonstrate that EO-VAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to the TerraMind tokenizers, establishing a robust baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing.

### DreamID-Omni: Unified Framework for Controllable Human-Centric Audio-Video Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12160v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12160v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12160v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12160v1)

2026/02/12 16:41 GTM

Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.

### TexSpot: 3D Texture Enhancement with Spatially-uniform Point Latent Representation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12157v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12157v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12157v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12157v1)

2026/02/12 16:37 GTM

High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

### FAIL: Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning for Image Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12155v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12155v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12155v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12155v1)

2026/02/12 16:36 GTM

Post-training of flow matching models-aligning the output distribution with a high-quality target-is mathematically equivalent to imitation learning. While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. Furthermore, the framework generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation, and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/HansPolo113/FAIL.

### PosterOmni: Generalized Artistic Poster Creation via Task Distillation and Unified Reward Feedback
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12127v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12127v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12127v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12127v1)

2026/02/12 16:16 GTM

Image-to-poster generation is a high-demand task requiring not only local adjustments but also high-level design understanding. Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.

### Iskra: A System for Inverse Geometry Processing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12105v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12105v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12105v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12105v1)

2026/02/12 15:59 GTM

We propose a system for differentiating through solutions to geometry processing problems. Our system differentiates a broad class of geometric algorithms, exploiting existing fast problem-specific schemes common to geometry processing, including local-global and ADMM solvers. It is compatible with machine learning frameworks, opening doors to new classes of inverse geometry processing applications. We marry the scatter-gather approach to mesh processing with tensor-based workflows and rely on the adjoint method applied to user-specified imperative code to generate an efficient backward pass behind the scenes. We demonstrate our approach by differentiating through mean curvature flow, spectral conformal parameterization, geodesic distance computation, and as-rigid-as-possible deformation, examining usability and performance on these applications. Our system allows practitioners to differentiate through existing geometry processing algorithms without needing to reformulate them, resulting in low implementation effort, fast runtimes, and lower memory requirements than differentiable optimization tools not tailored to geometry processing.

### AssetFormer: Modular 3D Assets Generation with Autoregressive Transformer
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12100v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12100v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12100v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12100v1)

2026/02/12 15:55 GTM

The digital industry demands high-quality, diverse modular 3D assets, especially for user-generated content~(UGC). In this work, we introduce AssetFormer, an autoregressive Transformer-based model designed to generate modular 3D assets from textual descriptions. Our pilot study leverages real-world modular assets collected from online platforms. AssetFormer tackles the challenge of creating assets composed of primitives that adhere to constrained design parameters for various applications. By innovatively adapting module sequencing and decoding techniques inspired by language models, our approach enhances asset generation quality through autoregressive modeling. Initial results indicate the effectiveness of AssetFormer in streamlining asset creation for professional development and UGC scenarios. This work presents a flexible framework extendable to various types of modular 3D assets, contributing to the broader field of 3D content generation. The code is available at https://github.com/Advocate99/AssetFormer.

### GigaBrain-0.5M*: a VLA That Learns From World Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12099v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12099v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12099v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12099v1)

2026/02/12 15:55 GTM

Vision-language-action (VLA) models that directly predict multi-step action chunks from current observations face inherent limitations due to constrained scene understanding and weak future anticipation capabilities. In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*}, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Built upon \textit{GigaBrain-0.5}, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*} further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via \textit{RAMP} (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that \textit{RAMP} achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\% on challenging tasks including \texttt{Laundry Folding}, \texttt{Box Packing}, and \texttt{Espresso Preparation}. Critically, \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M$^*$} exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our \href{https://gigabrain05m.github.io}{project page}.

### DeepSight: An All-in-One LM Safety Toolkit
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12092v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12092v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12092v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12092v1)

2026/02/12 15:43 GTM

As the development of Large Models (LMs) progresses rapidly, their safety is also a priority. In current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) safety workflow, evaluation, diagnosis, and alignment are often handled by separate tools. Specifically, safety evaluation can only locate external behavioral risks but cannot figure out internal root causes. Meanwhile, safety diagnosis often drifts from concrete risk scenarios and remains at the explainable level. In this way, safety alignment lack dedicated explanations of changes in internal mechanisms, potentially degrading general capabilities. To systematically address these issues, we propose an open-source project, namely DeepSight, to practice a new safety evaluation-diagnosis integrated paradigm. DeepSight is low-cost, reproducible, efficient, and highly scalable large-scale model safety evaluation project consisting of a evaluation toolkit DeepSafe and a diagnosis toolkit DeepScan. By unifying task and data protocols, we build a connection between the two stages and transform safety evaluation from black-box to white-box insight. Besides, DeepSight is the first open source toolkit that support the frontier AI risk evaluation and joint safety evaluation and diagnosis.

### A DMD-Based Adaptive Modulation Method for High Dynamic Range Imaging in High-Glare Environments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12044v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12044v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12044v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12044v1)

2026/02/12 15:10 GTM

Background The accuracy of photomechanics measurements critically relies on image quality,particularly under extreme illumination conditions such as welding arc monitoring and polished metallic surface analysis. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging above 120 dB is essential in these contexts. Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors, with dynamic ranges typically below 70 dB, are highly susceptible to saturation under glare, resulting in irreversible loss of detail and significant errors in digital image correlation (DIC). Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate.

### Projected Representation Conditioning for High-fidelity Novel View Synthesis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12003v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12003v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12003v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12003v1)

2026/02/12 14:35 GTM

We propose a novel framework for diffusion-based novel view synthesis in which we leverage external representations as conditions, harnessing their geometric and semantic correspondence properties for enhanced geometric consistency in generated novel viewpoints. First, we provide a detailed analysis exploring the correspondence capabilities emergent in the spatial attention of external visual representations. Building from these insights, we propose a representation-guided novel view synthesis through dedicated representation projection modules that inject external representations into the diffusion process, a methodology named ReNoV, short for representation-guided novel view synthesis. Our experiments show that this design yields marked improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and inpainting quality, outperforming prior diffusion-based novel-view methods on standard benchmarks and enabling robust synthesis from sparse, unposed image collections.

### Can Local Vision-Language Models improve Activity Recognition over Vision Transformers? -- Case Study on Newborn Resuscitation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12002v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12002v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12002v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12002v1)

2026/02/12 14:31 GTM

Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is essential for quality improvement and adherence to clinical guidelines, yet remains underutilized in practice. Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70.

### Spatial Chain-of-Thought: Bridging Understanding and Generation Models for Spatial Reasoning Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11980v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11980v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11980v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11980v1)

While diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in aesthetic image synthesis, they often struggle with complex spatial understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

### Calibrated Bayesian Deep Learning for Explainable Decision Support Systems Based on Medical Imaging
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11973v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11973v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11973v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11973v1)

In critical decision support systems based on medical imaging, the reliability of AI-assisted decision-making is as relevant as predictive accuracy. Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.

### UPDA: Unsupervised Progressive Domain Adaptation for No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11969v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11969v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11969v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11969v1)

While no-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) approaches have achieved significant progress over the past decade, their performance often degrades substantially when a distribution gap exists between the training (source domain) and testing (target domain) data. However, to date, limited attention has been paid to transferring NR-PCQA models across domains. To address this challenge, we propose the first unsupervised progressive domain adaptation (UPDA) framework for NR-PCQA, which introduces a two-stage coarse-to-fine alignment paradigm to address domain shifts. At the coarse-grained stage, a discrepancy-aware coarse-grained alignment method is designed to capture relative quality relationships between cross-domain samples through a novel quality-discrepancy-aware hybrid loss, circumventing the challenges of direct absolute feature alignment. At the fine-grained stage, a perception fusion fine-grained alignment approach with symmetric feature fusion is developed to identify domain-invariant features, while a conditional discriminator selectively enhances the transfer of quality-relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed UPDA effectively enhances the performance of NR-PCQA methods in cross-domain scenarios, validating its practical applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/yokeno1/UPDA-main.

### Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for French PDF-to-Markdown Conversion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11960v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11960v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11960v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11960v1)

This report evaluates PDF-to-Markdown conversion using recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging French documents. Document parsing is a critical step for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where transcription and layout errors propagate to downstream retrieval and grounding. Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.
  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

### Synthesis of Late Gadolinium Enhancement Images via Implicit Neural Representations for Cardiac Scar Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11942v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11942v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11942v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11942v1)

Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the clinical standard for myocardial scar assessment, but limited annotated datasets hinder the development of automated segmentation methods. We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available.

### DynaHOI: Benchmarking Hand-Object Interaction for Dynamic Target
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11919v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11919v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11919v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11919v1)

2026/02/12 13:19 GTM

Most existing hand motion generation benchmarks for hand-object interaction (HOI) focus on static objects, leaving dynamic scenarios with moving targets and time-critical coordination largely untested. To address this gap, we introduce the DynaHOI-Gym, a unified online closed-loop platform with parameterized motion generators and rollout-based metrics for dynamic capture evaluation. Built on DynaHOI-Gym, we release DynaHOI-10M, a large-scale benchmark with 10M frames and 180K hand capture trajectories, whose target motions are organized into 8 major categories and 22 fine-grained subcategories. We also provide a simple observe-before-act baseline (ObAct) that integrates short-term observations with the current frame via spatiotemporal attention to predict actions, achieving an 8.1% improvement in location success rate.

### Learning Perceptual Representations for Gaming NR-VQA with Multi-Task FR Signals
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11903v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11903v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11903v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11903v1)

No-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) for gaming videos is challenging due to limited human-rated datasets and unique content characteristics including fast motion, stylized graphics, and compression artifacts. We present MTL-VQA, a multi-task learning framework that uses full-reference metrics as supervisory signals to learn perceptually meaningful features without human labels for pretraining. By jointly optimizing multiple full-reference (FR) objectives with adaptive task weighting, our approach learns shared representations that transfer effectively to NR-VQA. Experiments on gaming video datasets show MTL-VQA achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art NR-VQA methods across both MOS-supervised and label-efficient/self-supervised settings.

### Where Bits Matter in World Model Planning: A Paired Mixed-Bit Study for Efficient Spatial Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11882v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11882v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11882v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11882v1)

Efficient spatial reasoning requires world models that remain reliable under tight precision budgets. We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning. Code and run artifacts are available at https://github.com/suraj-ranganath/DINO-MBQuant.

### SynthRAR: Ring Artifacts Reduction in CT with Unrolled Network and Synthetic Data Training
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11880v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11880v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11880v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11880v1)

2026/02/12 12:30 GTM

Defective and inconsistent responses in CT detectors can cause ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them unusable for clinical purposes. In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

### DiffPlace: Street View Generation via Place-Controllable Diffusion Model Enhancing Place Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11875v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11875v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11875v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11875v1)

Generative models have advanced significantly in realistic image synthesis, with diffusion models excelling in quality and stability. Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition. Our results highlight the potential of generative models in enhancing scene-level and place-aware synthesis, providing a valuable approach for improving place recognition in autonomous driving

### Zooming without Zooming: Region-to-Image Distillation for Fine-Grained Multimodal Perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11858v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11858v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11858v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11858v1)

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass. Our code is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/Zooming-without-Zooming.

### Free Lunch for Stabilizing Rectified Flow Inversion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11850v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11850v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11850v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11850v1)

Rectified-Flow (RF)-based generative models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to traditional diffusion models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench demonstrate that our methods significantly improve inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity, while reducing the required number of neural function evaluations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

### WorldTree: Towards 4D Dynamic Worlds from Monocular Video using Tree-Chains
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11845v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11845v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11845v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11845v1)

Dynamic reconstruction has achieved remarkable progress, but there remain challenges in monocular input for more practical applications. The prevailing works attempt to construct efficient motion representations, but lack a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework, suffering from either holistic temporal optimization or coupled hierarchical spatial composition. To this end, we propose WorldTree, a unified framework comprising Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) that enables coarse-to-fine optimization based on the inheritance-based partition tree structure for hierarchical temporal decomposition, and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) that recursively query ancestral hierarchical structure to provide complementary spatial dynamics while specializing motion representations across ancestral nodes. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves 8.26% improvement of LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% improvement of mLPIPS on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

### JEPA-VLA: Video Predictive Embedding is Needed for VLA Models

Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

### A Comparative Study of MAP and LMMSE Estimators for Blind Inverse Problems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11814v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11814v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11814v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11814v1)

Maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) approaches are an effective framework for inverse problems with known forward operators, particularly when combined with expressive priors and careful parameter selection. In blind settings, however, their use becomes significantly less stable due to the inherent non-convexity of the problem and the potential non-identifiability of the solutions. (Linear) minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators provide a compelling alternative that can circumvent these limitations. In this work, we study synthetic two-dimensional blind deconvolution problems under fully controlled conditions, with complete prior knowledge of both the signal and kernel distributions. We compare tailored MAP algorithms with simple LMMSE estimators whose functional form is closely related to that of an optimal Tikhonov estimator. Our results show that, even in these highly controlled settings, MAP methods remain unstable and require extensive parameter tuning, whereas the LMMSE estimator yields a robust and reliable baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that the LMMSE solution can serve as an effective initialization for MAP approaches, improving their performance and reducing sensitivity to regularization parameters, thereby opening the door to future theoretical and practical developments.

### How to Sample High Quality 3D Fractals for Action Recognition Pre-Training?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11810v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11810v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11810v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11810v1)

Synthetic datasets are being recognized in the deep learning realm as a valuable alternative to exhaustively labeled real data. One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.

### Efficient Segment Anything with Depth-Aware Fusion and Limited Training Data

Segment Anything Models (SAM) achieve impressive universal segmentation performance but require massive datasets (e.g., 11M images) and rely solely on RGB inputs. Recent efficient variants reduce computation but still depend on large-scale training. We propose a lightweight RGB-D fusion framework that augments EfficientViT-SAM with monocular depth priors. Depth maps are generated with a pretrained estimator and fused mid-level with RGB features through a dedicated depth encoder. Trained on only 11.2k samples (less than 0.1\% of SA-1B), our method achieves higher accuracy than EfficientViT-SAM, showing that depth cues provide strong geometric priors for segmentation.

### Light4D: Training-Free Extreme Viewpoint 4D Video Relighting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11769v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11769v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11769v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11769v1)

Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

### Code2Worlds: Empowering Coding LLMs for 4D World Generation

Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

### Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy for Test-Time Adaptation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11743v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11743v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11743v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11743v1)

Mainstream Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for adapting vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, typically rely on Shannon Entropy (SE) at test time to measure prediction uncertainty and inconsistency. However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jinx630/ADTE.

### Mask What Matters: Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models with Object-Aligned Visual Contrastive Decoding

We study object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve visual contrastive decoding (VCD) by constructing an object-aligned auxiliary view. We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass. Empirically, our method demonstrates consistent gains on two popular object hallucination benchmarks across two MLLMs.

### Adapting Vision-Language Models for E-commerce Understanding at Scale

E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

### STVG-R1: Incentivizing Instance-Level Reasoning and Grounding in Videos via Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11730v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11730v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11730v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11730v1)

2026/02/12 08:53 GTM

In vision-language models (VLMs), misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates often induces hallucinations. This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA). Surprisingly, STVG-R1 also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation tasks, achieving a SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

### GSO-SLAM: Bidirectionally Coupled Gaussian Splatting and Direct Visual Odometry
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11714v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11714v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11714v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11714v1)

We propose GSO-SLAM, a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that leverages Gaussian scene representation. Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy.

### TG-Field: Geometry-Aware Radiative Gaussian Fields for Tomographic Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11705v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11705v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11705v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11705v1)

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene representation with superior efficiency and quality. While recent adaptations for computed tomography (CT) show promise, they struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose Tomographic Geometry Field (TG-Field), a geometry-aware Gaussian deformation framework tailored for both static and dynamic CT reconstruction. A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence. In addition, a motion-flow network models fine-grained respiratory motion to track local anatomical deformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TG-Field consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

### LLM-Driven 3D Scene Generation of Agricultural Simulation Environments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11706v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11706v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11706v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11706v1)

Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

### U-DAVI: Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion-Prior-Based Amortized Variational Inference for Image Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11704v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11704v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11704v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11704v1)

Ill-posed imaging inverse problems remain challenging due to the ambiguity in mapping degraded observations to clean images. Diffusion-based generative priors have recently shown promise, but typically rely on computationally intensive iterative sampling or per-instance optimization. Amortized variational inference frameworks address this inefficiency by learning a direct mapping from measurements to posteriors, enabling fast posterior sampling without requiring the optimization of a new posterior for every new set of measurements. However, they still struggle to reconstruct fine details and complex textures. To address this, we extend the amortized framework by injecting spatially adaptive perturbations to measurements during training, guided by uncertainty estimates, to emphasize learning in the most uncertain regions. Experiments on deblurring and super-resolution demonstrate that our method achieves superior or competitive performance to previous diffusion-based approaches, delivering more realistic reconstructions without the computational cost of iterative refinement.

### Semantically Conditioned Diffusion Models for Cerebral DSA Synthesis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11703v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11703v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11703v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11703v1)

2026/02/12 08:31 GTM

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease, yet its invasive nature and high acquisition cost severely limit large-scale data collection and public data sharing. Therefore, we developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) that synthesizes arterial-phase cerebral DSA frames under explicit control of anatomical circulation (anterior vs.\ posterior) and canonical C-arm positions. We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87). Distributional similarity to real DSA frames was supported by a low median Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 15.27. Our results indicate that semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSAs suitable for downstream algorithm development, research, and training.

### OMEGA-Avatar: One-shot Modeling of 360° Gaussian Avatars
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11693v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11693v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11693v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11693v1)

2026/02/12 08:16 GTM

Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D avatars from a single image remains a formidable challenge. We identified three desirable attributes of avatar generation: 1) the method should be feed-forward, 2) model a 360° full-head, and 3) should be animation-ready. However, current work addresses only two of the three points simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose OMEGA-Avatar, the first feed-forward framework that simultaneously generates a generalizable, 360°-complete, and animatable 3D Gaussian head from a single image. Starting from a feed-forward and animatable framework, we address the 360° full-head avatar generation problem with two novel components. First, to overcome poor hair modeling in full-head avatar generation, we introduce a semantic-aware mesh deformation module that integrates multi-view normals to optimize a FLAME head with hair while preserving its topology structure. Second, to enable effective feed-forward decoding of full-head features, we propose a multi-view feature splatting module that constructs a shared canonical UV representation from features across multiple views through differentiable bilinear splatting, hierarchical UV mapping, and visibility-aware fusion. This approach preserves both global structural coherence and local high-frequency details across all viewpoints, ensuring 360° consistency without per-instance optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMEGA-Avatar achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines in 360° full-head completeness while robustly preserving identity across different viewpoints.

### Beyond Pixels: Vector-to-Graph Transformation for Reliable Schematic Auditing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11678v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11678v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11678v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11678v1)

2026/02/12 07:50 GTM

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains. To facilitate further research, we release our benchmark and implementation at https://github.com/gm-embodied/V2G-Audit.

### RI-Mamba: Rotation-Invariant Mamba for Robust Text-to-Shape Retrieval
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11673v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11673v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11673v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11673v1)

3D assets have rapidly expanded in quantity and diversity due to the growing popularity of virtual reality and gaming. As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/ndkhanh360/RI-Mamba.git.

### U-Net with Hadamard Transform and DCT Latent Spaces for Next-day Wildfire Spread Prediction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11672v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11672v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11672v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11672v1)

2026/02/12 07:45 GTM

We developed a lightweight and computationally efficient tool for next-day wildfire spread prediction using multimodal satellite data as input. The deep learning model, which we call Transform Domain Fusion UNet (TD-FusionUNet), incorporates trainable Hadamard Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform layers that apply two-dimensional transforms, enabling the network to capture essential "frequency" components in orthogonalized latent spaces. Additionally, we introduce custom preprocessing techniques, including random margin cropping and a Gaussian mixture model, to enrich the representation of the sparse pre-fire masks and enhance the model's generalization capability. The TD-FusionUNet is evaluated on two datasets which are the Next-Day Wildfire Spread dataset released by Google Research in 2023, and WildfireSpreadTS dataset. Our proposed TD-FusionUNet achieves an F1 score of 0.591 with 370k parameters, outperforming the UNet baseline using ResNet18 as the encoder reported in the WildfireSpreadTS dataset while using substantially fewer parameters. These results show that the proposed latent space fusion model balances accuracy and efficiency under a lightweight setting, making it suitable for real time wildfire prediction applications in resource limited environments.

### Egocentric Gaze Estimation via Neck-Mounted Camera
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11669v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11669v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11669v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11669v1)

This paper introduces neck-mounted view gaze estimation, a new task that estimates user gaze from the neck-mounted camera perspective. Prior work on egocentric gaze estimation, which predicts device wearer's gaze location within the camera's field of view, mainly focuses on head-mounted cameras while alternative viewpoints remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains. We further analyze these results and discuss implications for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

### Clutt3R-Seg: Sparse-view 3D Instance Segmentation for Language-grounded Grasping in Cluttered Scenes
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11660v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11660v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11660v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11660v1)

Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x. The code is available at: https://github.com/jeonghonoh/clutt3r-seg.

### EmoSpace: Fine-Grained Emotion Prototype Learning for Immersive Affective Content Generation

Emotion is important for creating compelling virtual reality (VR) content. Although some generative methods have been applied to lower the barrier to creating emotionally rich content, they fail to capture the nuanced emotional semantics and the fine-grained control essential for immersive experiences. To address these limitations, we introduce EmoSpace, a novel framework for emotion-aware content generation that learns dynamic, interpretable emotion prototypes through vision-language alignment. We employ a hierarchical emotion representation with rich learnable prototypes that evolve during training, enabling fine-grained emotional control without requiring explicit emotion labels. We develop a controllable generation pipeline featuring multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting that supports diverse applications, including emotional image outpainting, stylized generation, and emotional panorama generation for VR environments. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of EmoSpace over existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Additionally, we present a comprehensive user study investigating how VR environments affect emotional perception compared to desktop settings. Our work facilitates immersive visual content generation with fine-grained emotion control and supports applications like therapy, education, storytelling, artistic creation, and cultural preservation. Code and models will be made publicly available.

### SToRM: Supervised Token Reduction for Multi-modal LLMs toward efficient end-to-end autonomous driving
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11656v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11656v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11656v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11656v1)

In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.
  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

### GR-Diffusion: 3D Gaussian Representation Meets Diffusion in Whole-Body PET Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11653v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11653v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11653v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11653v1)

Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a critical challenge in molecular imaging, often hampered by noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information. Experimental results on the UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

### Brain Tumor Classifiers Under Attack: Robustness of ResNet Variants Against Transferable FGSM and PGD Attacks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11646v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11646v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11646v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11646v1)

Adversarial robustness in deep learning models for brain tumor classification remains an underexplored yet critical challenge, particularly for clinical deployment scenarios involving MRI data. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis.

### ViTaS: Visual Tactile Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning for Visuomotor Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11643v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11643v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11643v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11643v1)

Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

### Electrostatics-Inspired Surface Reconstruction (EISR): Recovering 3D Shapes as a Superposition of Poisson's PDE Solutions

Implicit shape representation, such as SDFs, is a popular approach to recover the surface of a 3D shape as the level sets of a scalar field. Several methods approximate SDFs using machine learning strategies that exploit the knowledge that SDFs are solutions of the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDEs). In this work, we present a novel approach to surface reconstruction by encoding it as a solution to a proxy PDE, namely Poisson's equation. Then, we explore the connection between Poisson's equation and physics, e.g., the electrostatic potential due to a positive charge density. We employ Green's functions to obtain a closed-form parametric expression for the PDE's solution, and leverage the linearity of our proxy PDE to find the target shape's implicit field as a superposition of solutions. Our method shows improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors.

### ScalSelect: Scalable Training-Free Multimodal Data Selection for Efficient Visual Instruction Tuning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11636v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11636v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11636v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11636v1)

Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/ChangtiWu/ScalSelect}{ScalSelect}.

### PLESS: Pseudo-Label Enhancement with Spreading Scribbles for Weakly Supervised Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11628v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11628v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11628v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11628v1)

2026/02/12 06:24 GTM

Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.

### PLOT-CT: Pre-log Voronoi Decomposition Assisted Generation for Low-dose CT Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11625v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11625v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11625v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11625v1)

2026/02/12 06:20 GTM

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenged by severe noise and compromised data fidelity under reduced radiation exposure. Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain.

### Agentic Test-Time Scaling for WebAgents

Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.

### On-Policy Context Distillation for Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12275v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12275v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12275v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12275v1)

Context distillation enables language models to internalize in-context knowledge into their parameters. In our work, we propose On-Policy Context Distillation (OPCD), a framework that bridges on-policy distillation with context distillation by training a student model on its own generated trajectories while minimizing reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence against a context-conditioned teacher. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPCD on two important applications: experiential knowledge distillation, where models extract and consolidate transferable knowledge from their historical solution traces, and system prompt distillation, where models internalize beneficial behaviors encoded in optimized prompts. Across mathematical reasoning, text-based games, and domain-specific tasks, OPCD consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher task accuracy while better preserving out-of-distribution capabilities. We further show that OPCD enables effective cross-size distillation, where smaller student models can internalize experiential knowledge from larger teachers.

### T3D: Few-Step Diffusion Language Models via Trajectory Self-Distillation with Direct Discriminative Optimization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12262v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12262v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12262v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12262v1)

Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Tyrion58/T3D.

### A technical curriculum on language-oriented artificial intelligence in translation and specialised communication

This paper presents a technical curriculum on language-oriented artificial intelligence (AI) in the language and translation (L&T) industry. The curriculum aims to foster domain-specific technical AI literacy among stakeholders in the fields of translation and specialised communication by exposing them to the conceptual and technical/algorithmic foundations of modern language-oriented AI in an accessible way. The core curriculum focuses on 1) vector embeddings, 2) the technical foundations of neural networks, 3) tokenization and 4) transformer neural networks. It is intended to help users develop computational thinking as well as algorithmic awareness and algorithmic agency, ultimately contributing to their digital resilience in AI-driven work environments. The didactic suitability of the curriculum was tested in an AI-focused MA course at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication at TH Koeln. Results suggest the didactic effectiveness of the curriculum, but participant feedback indicates that it should be embedded into higher-level didactic scaffolding - e.g., in the form of lecturer support - in order to enable optimal learning conditions.

### "Sorry, I Didn't Catch That": How Speech Models Miss What Matters Most

Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

### Moonshine v2: Ergodic Streaming Encoder ASR for Latency-Critical Speech Applications
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12241v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12241v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12241v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12241v1)

Latency-critical speech applications (e.g., live transcription, voice commands, and real-time translation) demand low time-to-first-token (TTFT) and high transcription accuracy, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices. Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent "encode-the-whole-utterance" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster. These results demonstrate that carefully designed local attention is competitive with the accuracy of full attention at a fraction of the size and latency cost, opening new possibilities for interactive speech interfaces on edge devices.

### Olmix: A Framework for Data Mixing Throughout LM Development
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12237v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12237v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12237v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12237v1)

Data mixing -- determining the ratios of data from different domains -- is a first-order concern for training language models (LMs). While existing mixing methods show promise, they fall short when applied during real-world LM development. We present Olmix, a framework that addresses two such challenges. First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like data constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update. Over a sequence of five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse matches the performance of fully recomputing the mix after each update with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks.

### Detecting Overflow in Compressed Token Representations for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12235v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12235v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12235v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12235v1)

Efficient long-context processing remains a crucial challenge for contemporary large language models (LLMs), especially in resource-constrained environments. Soft compression architectures promise to extend effective context length by replacing long token sequences with smaller sets of learned compressed tokens. Yet, the limits of compressibility -- and when compression begins to erase task-relevant content -- remain underexplored. In this paper, we define \emph{token overflow} as a regime in which compressed representations no longer contain sufficient information to answer a given query, and propose a methodology to characterize and detect it. In the xRAG soft-compression setting, we find that query-agnostic saturation statistics reliably separate compressed from uncompressed token representations, providing a practical tool for identifying compressed tokens but showing limited overflow detection capability. Lightweight probing classifiers over both query and context xRAG representations detect overflow with 0.72 AUC-ROC on average on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating that incorporating query information improves detection performance. These results advance from query-independent diagnostics to query-aware detectors, enabling low-cost pre-LLM gating to mitigate compression-induced errors.

### ExStrucTiny: A Benchmark for Schema-Variable Structured Information Extraction from Document Images

Enterprise documents, such as forms and reports, embed critical information for downstream applications like data archiving, automated workflows, and analytics. Although generalist Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on established document understanding benchmarks, their ability to conduct holistic, fine-grained structured extraction across diverse document types and flexible schemas is not well studied. Existing Key Entity Extraction (KEE), Relation Extraction (RE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets are limited by narrow entity ontologies, simple queries, or homogeneous document types, often overlooking the need for adaptable and structured extraction. To address these gaps, we introduce ExStrucTiny, a new benchmark dataset for structured Information Extraction (IE) from document images, unifying aspects of KEE, RE, and VQA. Built through a novel pipeline combining manual and synthetic human-validated samples, ExStrucTiny covers more varied document types and extraction scenarios. We analyze open and closed VLMs on this benchmark, highlighting challenges such as schema adaptation, query under-specification, and answer localization. We hope our work provides a bedrock for improving generalist models for structured IE in documents.

### Visual Reasoning Benchmark: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Classroom-Authentic Visual Problems from Primary Education

AI models have achieved state-of-the-art results in textual reasoning; however, their ability to reason over spatial and relational structures remains a critical bottleneck -- particularly in early-grade maths, which relies heavily on visuals. This paper introduces the visual reasoning benchmark (VRB), a novel dataset designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to solve authentic visual problems from classrooms. This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions. Consequently, education-focused benchmarks like the VRB are essential for determining the functional boundaries of multimodal tools used in classrooms.

### Query-focused and Memory-aware Reranker for Long Context Processing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12192v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12192v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12192v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12192v1)

2026/02/12 17:23 GTM

Built upon the existing analysis of retrieval heads in large language models, we propose an alternative reranking framework that trains models to estimate passage-query relevance using the attention scores of selected heads. This approach provides a listwise solution that leverages holistic information within the entire candidate shortlist during ranking. At the same time, it naturally produces continuous relevance scores, enabling training on arbitrary retrieval datasets without requiring Likert-scale supervision. Our framework is lightweight and effective, requiring only small-scale models (e.g., 4B parameters) to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art pointwise and listwise rerankers across multiple domains, including Wikipedia and long narrative datasets. It further establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo benchmark that assesses the capabilities of dialogue understanding and memory usage. We further demonstrate that our framework supports flexible extensions. For example, augmenting candidate passages with contextual information further improves ranking accuracy, while training attention heads from middle layers enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance.

### Pedagogically-Inspired Data Synthesis for Language Model Knowledge Distillation

Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

### dVoting: Fast Voting for dLLMs

Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) represent a new paradigm beyond autoregressive modeling, offering competitive performance while naturally enabling a flexible decoding process. Specifically, dLLMs can generate tokens at arbitrary positions in parallel, endowing them with significant potential for parallel test-time scaling, which was previously constrained by severe inefficiency in autoregressive modeling. In this work, we introduce dVoting, a fast voting technique that boosts reasoning capability without training, with only an acceptable extra computational overhead. dVoting is motivated by the observation that, across multiple samples for the same prompt, token predictions remain largely consistent, whereas performance is determined by a small subset of tokens exhibiting cross-sample variability. Leveraging the arbitrary-position generation capability of dLLMs, dVoting performs iterative refinement by sampling, identifying uncertain tokens via consistency analysis, regenerating them through voting, and repeating this process until convergence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that dVoting consistently improves performance across various benchmarks. It achieves gains of 6.22%-7.66% on GSM8K, 4.40%-7.20% on MATH500, 3.16%-14.84% on ARC-C, and 4.83%-5.74% on MMLU. Our code is available at https://github.com/fscdc/dVoting

### GPT-4o Lacks Core Features of Theory of Mind

Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

### Seq2Seq2Seq: Lossless Data Compression via Discrete Latent Transformers and Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12146v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12146v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12146v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12146v1)

Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

### CitiLink-Minutes: A Multilayer Annotated Dataset of Municipal Meeting Minutes
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12137v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12137v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12137v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12137v1)

City councils play a crucial role in local governance, directly influencing citizens' daily lives through decisions made during municipal meetings. These deliberations are formally documented in meeting minutes, which serve as official records of discussions, decisions, and voting outcomes. Despite their importance, municipal meeting records have received little attention in Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), largely due to the lack of annotated datasets, which ultimately limit the development of computational models. To address this gap, we introduce CitiLink-Minutes, a multilayer dataset of 120 European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes from six municipalities. Unlike prior annotated datasets of parliamentary or video records, CitiLink-Minutes provides multilayer annotations and structured linkage of official written minutes. The dataset contains over one million tokens, with all personal identifiers de-identified. Each minute was manually annotated by two trained annotators and curated by an experienced linguist across three complementary dimensions: (1) metadata, (2) subjects of discussion, and (3) voting outcomes, totaling over 38,000 individual annotations. Released under FAIR principles and accompanied by baseline results on metadata extraction, topic classification, and vote labeling, CitiLink-Minutes demonstrates its potential for downstream NLP and IR tasks, while promoting transparent access to municipal decisions.

### WavBench: Benchmarking Reasoning, Colloquialism, and Paralinguistics for End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Models

With the rapid integration of advanced reasoning capabilities into spoken dialogue models, the field urgently demands benchmarks that transcend simple interactions to address real-world complexity. However, current evaluations predominantly adhere to text-generation standards, overlooking the unique audio-centric characteristics of paralinguistics and colloquialisms, alongside the cognitive depth required by modern agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce WavBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate realistic conversational abilities where prior works fall short. Uniquely, WavBench establishes a tripartite framework: 1) Pro subset, designed to rigorously challenge reasoning-enhanced models with significantly increased difficulty; 2) Basic subset, defining a novel standard for spoken colloquialism that prioritizes "listenability" through natural vocabulary, linguistic fluency, and interactive rapport, rather than rigid written accuracy; and 3) Acoustic subset, covering explicit understanding, generation, and implicit dialogue to rigorously evaluate comprehensive paralinguistic capabilities within authentic real-world scenarios. Through evaluating five state-of-the-art models, WavBench offers critical insights into the intersection of complex problem-solving, colloquial delivery, and paralinguistic fidelity, guiding the evolution of robust spoken dialogue models. The benchmark dataset and evaluation toolkit are available at https://naruto-2024.github.io/wavbench.github.io/.

### Neutral Prompts, Non-Neutral People: Quantifying Gender and Skin-Tone Bias in Gemini Flash 2.5 Image and GPT Image 1.5

This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

### A Rule-based Computational Model for Gaidhlig Morphology

Language models and software tools are essential to support the continuing vitality of lesser-used languages; however, currently popular neural models require considerable data for training, which normally is not available for such low-resource languages. This paper describes work-in-progress to construct a rule-based model of Gaidhlig morphology using data from Wiktionary, arguing that rule-based systems effectively leverage limited sample data, support greater interpretability, and provide insights useful in the design of teaching materials. The use of SQL for querying the occurrence of different lexical patterns is investigated, and a declarative rule-base is presented that allows Python utilities to derive inflected forms of Gaidhlig words. This functionality could be used to support educational tools that teach or explain language patterns, for example, or to support higher level tools such as rule-based dependency parsers. This approach adds value to the data already present in Wiktionary by adapting it to new use-cases.

### Learning beyond Teacher: Generalized On-Policy Distillation with Reward Extrapolation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12125v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12125v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12125v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12125v1)

2026/02/12 16:14 GTM

On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD.

While most AI alignment research focuses on preventing models from generating explicitly harmful content, a more subtle risk is emerging: capability-oriented training induced exploitation. We investigate whether language models, when trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in environments with implicit loopholes, will spontaneously learn to exploit these flaws to maximize their reward, even without any malicious intent in their training. To test this, we design a suite of four diverse "vulnerability games", each presenting a unique, exploitable flaw related to context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation. Our experiments show that models consistently learn to exploit these vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increase their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. More critically, we find that these exploitative strategies are not narrow "tricks" but generalizable skills; they can be transferred to new tasks and even "distilled" from a capable teacher model to other student models through data alone. Our findings reveal that capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches, suggesting that future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing the training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

### Meta-Sel: Efficient Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Supervised Meta-Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12123v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12123v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12123v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12123v1)

Demonstration selection is a practical bottleneck in in-context learning (ICL): under a tight prompt budget, accuracy can change substantially depending on which few-shot examples are included, yet selection must remain cheap enough to run per query over large candidate pools. We propose Meta-Sel, a lightweight supervised meta-learning approach for intent classification that learns a fast, interpretable scoring function for (candidate, query) pairs from labeled training data.
  Meta-Sel constructs a meta-dataset by sampling pairs from the training split and using class agreement as supervision, then trains a calibrated logistic regressor on two inexpensive meta-features: TF--IDF cosine similarity and a length-compatibility ratio. At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights.
  Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead.

### P-GenRM: Personalized Generative Reward Model with Test-time User-based Scaling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12116v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12116v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12116v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12116v1)

Personalized alignment of large language models seeks to adapt responses to individual user preferences, typically via reinforcement learning. A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.

### Stop Unnecessary Reflection: Training LRMs for Efficient Reasoning with Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12113v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12113v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12113v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12113v1)

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

### DeepSight: An All-in-One LM Safety Toolkit
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12092v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12092v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12092v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12092v1)

As the development of Large Models (LMs) progresses rapidly, their safety is also a priority. In current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) safety workflow, evaluation, diagnosis, and alignment are often handled by separate tools. Specifically, safety evaluation can only locate external behavioral risks but cannot figure out internal root causes. Meanwhile, safety diagnosis often drifts from concrete risk scenarios and remains at the explainable level. In this way, safety alignment lack dedicated explanations of changes in internal mechanisms, potentially degrading general capabilities. To systematically address these issues, we propose an open-source project, namely DeepSight, to practice a new safety evaluation-diagnosis integrated paradigm. DeepSight is low-cost, reproducible, efficient, and highly scalable large-scale model safety evaluation project consisting of a evaluation toolkit DeepSafe and a diagnosis toolkit DeepScan. By unifying task and data protocols, we build a connection between the two stages and transform safety evaluation from black-box to white-box insight. Besides, DeepSight is the first open source toolkit that support the frontier AI risk evaluation and joint safety evaluation and diagnosis.

### Tiny Recursive Reasoning with Mamba-2 Attention Hybrid
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12078v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12078v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12078v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12078v1)

Recent work on recursive reasoning models like TRM demonstrates that tiny networks (7M parameters) can achieve strong performance on abstract reasoning tasks through latent recursion -- iterative refinement in hidden representation space without emitting intermediate tokens. This raises a natural question about operator choice: Mamba-2's state space recurrence is itself a form of iterative refinement, making it a natural candidate for recursive reasoning -- but does introducing Mamba-2 into the recursive scaffold preserve reasoning capability? We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\% (45.88\% vs 43.88\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning.

### Composition-RL: Compose Your Verifiable Prompts for Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12036v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12036v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12036v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12036v1)

Large-scale verifiable prompts underpin the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but they contain many uninformative examples and are costly to expand further. Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with a pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into a new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that Composition-RL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset. Performance can be further boosted with a curriculum variant of Composition-RL that gradually increases compositional depth over training. Additionally, Composition-RL enables more effective cross-domain RL by composing prompts drawn from different domains. Codes, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/XinXU-USTC/Composition-RL.

### Artificial intelligence is creating a new global linguistic hierarchy
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12018v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12018v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12018v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12018v1)

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, education, governance and socioeconomic equity, but its benefits remain concentrated in a small number of languages (Bender, 2019; Blasi et al., 2022; Joshi et al., 2020; Ranathunga and de Silva, 2022; Young, 2015). Language AI - the technologies that underpin widely-used conversational systems such as ChatGPT - could provide major benefits if available in people's native languages, yet most of the world's 7,000+ linguistic communities currently lack access and face persistent digital marginalization. Here we present a global longitudinal analysis of social, economic and infrastructural conditions across languages to assess systemic inequalities in language AI. We first analyze the existence of AI resources for 6003 languages. We find that despite efforts of the community to broaden the reach of language technologies (Bapna et al., 2022; Costa-Jussà et al., 2022), the dominance of a handful of languages is exacerbating disparities on an unprecedented scale, with divides widening exponentially rather than narrowing. Further, we contrast the longitudinal diffusion of AI with that of earlier IT technologies, revealing a distinctive hype-driven pattern of spread. To translate our findings into practical insights and guide prioritization efforts, we introduce the Language AI Readiness Index (EQUATE), which maps the state of technological, socio-economic, and infrastructural prerequisites for AI deployment across languages. The index highlights communities where capacity exists but remains underutilized, and provides a framework for accelerating more equitable diffusion of language AI. Our work contributes to setting the baseline for a transition towards more sustainable and equitable language technologies.

### Disentangling Ambiguity from Instability in Large Language Models: A Clinical Text-to-SQL Case Study
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12015v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12015v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12015v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12015v1)

2026/02/12 14:46 GTM

Deploying large language models for clinical Text-to-SQL requires distinguishing two qualitatively different causes of output diversity: (i) input ambiguity that should trigger clarification, and (ii) model instability that should trigger human review. We propose CLUES, a framework that models Text-to-SQL as a two-stage process (interpretations --> answers) and decomposes semantic uncertainty into an ambiguity score and an instability score. The instability score is computed via the Schur complement of a bipartite semantic graph matrix. Across AmbigQA/SituatedQA (gold interpretations) and a clinical Text-to-SQL benchmark (known interpretations), CLUES improves failure prediction over state-of-the-art Kernel Language Entropy. In deployment settings, it remains competitive while providing a diagnostic decomposition unavailable from a single score. The resulting uncertainty regimes map to targeted interventions - query refinement for ambiguity, model improvement for instability. The high-ambiguity/high-instability regime contains 51% of errors while covering 25% of queries, enabling efficient triage.

### LaCy: What Small Language Models Can and Should Learn is Not Just a Question of Loss
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12005v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12005v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12005v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12005v1)

Language models have consistently grown to compress more world knowledge into their parameters, but the knowledge that can be pretrained into them is upper-bounded by their parameter size. Especially the capacity of Small Language Models (SLMs) is limited, leading to factually incorrect generations. This problem is often mitigated by giving the SLM access to an outside source: the ability to query a larger model, documents, or a database. Under this setting, we study the fundamental question of \emph{which tokens an SLM can and should learn} during pretraining, versus \emph{which ones it should delegate} via a \texttt{<CALL>} token. We find that this is not simply a question of loss: although the loss is predictive of whether a predicted token mismatches the ground-truth, some tokens are \emph{acceptable} in that they are truthful alternative continuations of a pretraining document, and should not trigger a \texttt{<CALL>} even if their loss is high. We find that a spaCy grammar parser can help augment the loss signal to decide which tokens the SLM should learn to delegate to prevent factual errors and which are safe to learn and predict even under high losses. We propose LaCy, a novel pretraining method based on this token selection philosophy. Our experiments demonstrate that LaCy models successfully learn which tokens to predict and where to delegate for help. This results in higher FactScores when generating in a cascade with a bigger model and outperforms Rho or LLM-judge trained SLMs, while being simpler and cheaper.

### Automatic Simplification of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Descriptions

Understanding cyber security is increasingly important for individuals and organizations. However, a lot of information related to cyber security can be difficult to understand to those not familiar with the topic. In this study, we focus on investigating how large language models (LLMs) could be utilized in automatic text simplification (ATS) of Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) descriptions. Automatic text simplification has been studied in several contexts, such as medical, scientific, and news texts, but it has not yet been studied to simplify texts in the rapidly changing and complex domain of cyber security. We created a baseline for cyber security ATS and a test dataset of 40 CVE descriptions, evaluated by two groups of cyber security experts in two survey rounds. We have found that while out-of-the box LLMs can make the text appear simpler, they struggle with meaning preservation. Code and data are available at https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/vehomav1/simplification\_nmi.

### DHPLT: large-scale multilingual diachronic corpora and word representations for semantic change modelling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11968v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11968v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11968v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11968v1)

2026/02/12 14:01 GTM

In this resource paper, we present DHPLT, an open collection of diachronic corpora in 41 diverse languages. DHPLT is based on the web-crawled HPLT datasets; we use web crawl timestamps as the approximate signal of document creation time. The collection covers three time periods: 2011-2015, 2020-2021 and 2024-present (1 million documents per time period for each language). We additionally provide pre-computed word type and token embeddings and lexical substitutions for our chosen target words, while at the same time leaving it open for the other researchers to come up with their own target words using the same datasets. DHPLT aims at filling in the current lack of multilingual diachronic corpora for semantic change modelling (beyond a dozen of high-resource languages). It opens the way for a variety of new experimental setups in this field. All the resources described in this paper are available at https://data.hplt-project.org/three/diachronic/, sorted by language.

### Scaling Model and Data for Multilingual Machine Translation with Open Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11961v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11961v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11961v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11961v1)

Open large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated improving multilingual capabilities in recent years. In this paper, we present a study of open LLMs for multilingual machine translation (MT) across a range of languages, and investigate the effects of model scaling and data scaling when adapting open LLMs to multilingual MT through continual pretraining and instruction finetuning. Based on the Gemma3 model family, we develop MiLMMT-46, which achieves top-tier multilingual translation performance across 46 languages. Extensive experiments show that MiLMMT-46 consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, including Seed-X, HY-MT-1.5, and TranslateGemma, and achieves competitive performance with strong proprietary systems such as Google Translate and Gemini 3 Pro.

### Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for French PDF-to-Markdown Conversion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11960v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11960v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11960v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11960v1)

2026/02/12 13:55 GTM

This report evaluates PDF-to-Markdown conversion using recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging French documents. Document parsing is a critical step for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where transcription and layout errors propagate to downstream retrieval and grounding. Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.
  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

### RAM-Net: Expressive Linear Attention with Selectively Addressable Memory
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11958v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11958v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11958v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11958v1)

2026/02/12 13:55 GTM

While linear attention architectures offer efficient inference, compressing unbounded history into a fixed-size memory inherently limits expressivity and causes information loss. To address this limitation, we introduce Random Access Memory Network (RAM-Net), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between the representational capacity of full attention and the memory efficiency of linear models. The core of RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses, allowing the model to selectively access a massive memory state. This design enables exponential state size scaling without additional parameters, which significantly mitigates signal interference and enhances retrieval fidelity. Moreover, the inherent sparsity ensures exceptional computational efficiency, as state updates are confined to minimal entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM-Net consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval tasks and achieves competitive performance in standard language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks, validating its superior capability to capture complex dependencies with significantly reduced computational overhead.

### Do Large Language Models Adapt to Language Variation across Socioeconomic Status?

Humans adjust their linguistic style to the audience they are addressing. However, the extent to which LLMs adapt to different social contexts is largely unknown. As these models increasingly mediate human-to-human communication, their failure to adapt to diverse styles can perpetuate stereotypes and marginalize communities whose linguistic norms are less closely mirrored by the models, thereby reinforcing social stratification. We study the extent to which LLMs integrate into social media communication across different socioeconomic status (SES) communities. We collect a novel dataset from Reddit and YouTube, stratified by SES. We prompt four LLMs with incomplete text from that corpus and compare the LLM-generated completions to the originals along 94 sociolinguistic metrics, including syntactic, rhetorical, and lexical features. LLMs modulate their style with respect to SES to only a minor extent, often resulting in approximation or caricature, and tend to emulate the style of upper SES more effectively. Our findings (1) show how LLMs risk amplifying linguistic hierarchies and (2) call into question their validity for agent-based social simulation, survey experiments, and any research relying on language style as a social signal.

### Who is the richest club in the championship? Detecting and Rewriting Underspecified Questions Improve QA Performance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11938v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11938v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11938v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11938v1)

2026/02/12 13:36 GTM

Large language models (LLMs) perform well on well-posed questions, yet standard question-answering (QA) benchmarks remain far from solved. We argue that this gap is partly due to underspecified questions - queries whose interpretation cannot be uniquely determined without additional context. To test this hypothesis, we introduce an LLM-based classifier to identify underspecified questions and apply it to several widely used QA datasets, finding that 16% to over 50% of benchmark questions are underspecified and that LLMs perform significantly worse on them. To isolate the effect of underspecification, we conduct a controlled rewriting experiment that serves as an upper-bound analysis, rewriting underspecified questions into fully specified variants while holding gold answers fixed. QA performance consistently improves under this setting, indicating that many apparent QA failures stem from question underspecification rather than model limitations. Our findings highlight underspecification as an important confound in QA evaluation and motivate greater attention to question clarity in benchmark design.

### Cross-Modal Robustness Transfer (CMRT): Training Robust Speech Translation Models Using Adversarial Text
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11933v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11933v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11933v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11933v1)

2026/02/12 13:30 GTM

End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) has seen significant advancements, yet current models are primarily benchmarked on curated, "clean" datasets. This overlooks critical real-world challenges, such as morphological robustness to inflectional variations common in non-native or dialectal speech. In this work, we adapt a text-based adversarial attack targeting inflectional morphology to the speech domain and demonstrate that state-of-the-art E2E-ST models are highly vulnerable it. While adversarial training effectively mitigates such risks in text-based tasks, generating high-quality adversarial speech data remains computationally expensive and technically challenging. To address this, we propose Cross-Modal Robustness Transfer (CMRT), a framework that transfers adversarial robustness from the text modality to the speech modality. Our method eliminates the requirement for adversarial speech data during training. Extensive experiments across four language pairs demonstrate that CMRT improves adversarial robustness by an average of more than 3 BLEU points, establishing a new baseline for robust E2E-ST without the overhead of generating adversarial speech.

### AdaptEvolve: Improving Efficiency of Evolutionary AI Agents through Adaptive Model Selection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11931v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11931v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11931v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11931v1)

Evolutionary agentic systems intensify the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning capability by repeatedly invoking large language models (LLMs) during inference. This setting raises a central question: how can an agent dynamically select an LLM that is sufficiently capable for the current generation step while remaining computationally efficient? While model cascades offer a practical mechanism for balancing this trade-off, existing routing strategies typically rely on static heuristics or external controllers and do not explicitly account for model uncertainty. We introduce AdaptEvolve: Adaptive LLM Selection for Multi-LLM Evolutionary Refinement within an evolutionary sequential refinement framework that leverages intrinsic generation confidence to estimate real-time solvability. Empirical results show that confidence-driven selection yields a favourable Pareto frontier, reducing total inference cost by an average of 37.9% across benchmarks while retaining 97.5% of the upper-bound accuracy of static large-model baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/raypretam/adaptive_llm_selection.

### When Should LLMs Be Less Specific? Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11908v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11908v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11908v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11908v1)

LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

### Benchmark Illusion: Disagreement among LLMs and Its Scientific Consequences

Benchmarks underpin how progress in large language models (LLMs) is measured and trusted. Yet our analyses reveal that apparent convergence in benchmark accuracy can conceal deep epistemic divergence. Using two major reasoning benchmarks - MMLU-Pro and GPQA - we show that LLMs achieving comparable accuracy still disagree on 16-66% of items, and 16-38% among top-performing frontier models. These discrepancies suggest distinct error profiles for different LLMs. When such models are used for scientific data annotation and inference, their hidden disagreements propagate into research results: in re-analyses of published studies in education and political science, switching the annotation model can change estimated treatment effects by more than 80%, and in some cases reverses their sign. Together, these findings illustrate a benchmark illusion, where equal accuracy may conceal disagreement, with model choice becoming a hidden yet consequential variable for scientific reproducibility.

Corporate financial reports are a valuable source of structured knowledge for Knowledge Graph construction, but the lack of annotated ground truth in this domain makes evaluation difficult. We present a semi-automated pipeline for Subject-Predicate-Object triplet extraction that uses ontology-driven proxy metrics, specifically Ontology Conformance and Faithfulness, instead of ground-truth-based evaluation. We compare a static, manually engineered ontology against a fully automated, document-specific ontology induction approach across different LLMs and two corporate annual reports. The automatically induced ontology achieves 100% schema conformance in all configurations, eliminating the ontology drift observed with the manual approach. We also propose a hybrid verification strategy that combines regex matching with an LLM-as-a-judge check, reducing apparent subject hallucination rates from 65.2% to 1.6% by filtering false positives caused by coreference resolution. Finally, we identify a systematic asymmetry between subject and object hallucinations, which we attribute to passive constructions and omitted agents in financial prose.

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved success, but cost and privacy constraints necessitate deploying smaller models locally while offloading complex queries to cloud-based models. Existing router evaluations are unsystematic, overlooking scenario-specific requirements and out-of-distribution robustness. We propose RouterXBench, a principled evaluation framework with three dimensions: router ability, scenario alignment, and cross-domain robustness. Unlike prior work that relies on output probabilities or external embeddings, we utilize internal hidden states that capture model uncertainty before answer generation. We introduce ProbeDirichlet, a lightweight router that aggregates cross-layer hidden states via learnable Dirichlet distributions with probabilistic training. Trained on multi-domain data, it generalizes robustly across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. Our results show ProbeDirichlet achieves 16.68% and 18.86% relative improvements over the best baselines in router ability and high-accuracy scenarios, with consistent performance across model families, model scales, heterogeneous tasks, and agentic workflows.

### DMAP: A Distribution Map for Text

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful tool for statistical text analysis, with derived sequences of next-token probability distributions offering a wealth of information. Extracting this signal typically relies on metrics such as perplexity, which do not adequately account for context; how one should interpret a given next-token probability is dependent on the number of reasonable choices encoded by the shape of the conditional distribution. In this work, we present DMAP, a mathematically grounded method that maps a text, via a language model, to a set of samples in the unit interval that jointly encode rank and probability information. This representation enables efficient, model-agnostic analysis and supports a range of applications. We illustrate its utility through three case studies: (i) validation of generation parameters to ensure data integrity, (ii) examining the role of probability curvature in machine-generated text detection, and (iii) a forensic analysis revealing statistical fingerprints left in downstream models that have been subject to post-training on synthetic data. Our results demonstrate that DMAP offers a unified statistical view of text that is simple to compute on consumer hardware, widely applicable, and provides a foundation for further research into text analysis with LLMs.

### A$^{2}$V-SLP: Alignment-Aware Variational Modeling for Disentangled Sign Language Production
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11861v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11861v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11861v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11861v1)

2026/02/12 12:07 GTM

Building upon recent structural disentanglement frameworks for sign language production, we propose A$^{2}$V-SLP, an alignment-aware variational framework that learns articulator-wise disentangled latent distributions rather than deterministic embeddings. A disentangled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes ground-truth sign pose sequences and extracts articulator-specific mean and variance vectors, which are used as distributional supervision for training a non-autoregressive Transformer. Given text embeddings, the Transformer predicts both latent means and log-variances, while the VAE decoder reconstructs the final sign pose sequences through stochastic sampling at the decoding stage. This formulation maintains articulator-level representations by avoiding deterministic latent collapse through distributional latent modeling. In addition, we integrate a gloss attention mechanism to strengthen alignment between linguistic input and articulated motion. Experimental results show consistent gains over deterministic latent regression, achieving state-of-the-art back-translation performance and improved motion realism in a fully gloss-free setting.

### Zooming without Zooming: Region-to-Image Distillation for Fine-Grained Multimodal Perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11858v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11858v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11858v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11858v1)

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass. Our code is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/Zooming-without-Zooming.

### Prototype Transformer: Towards Language Model Architectures Interpretable by Design
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11852v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11852v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11852v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11852v1)

While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

### A Subword Embedding Approach for Variation Detection in Luxembourgish User Comments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11795v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11795v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11795v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11795v1)

This paper presents an embedding-based approach to detecting variation without relying on prior normalisation or predefined variant lists. The method trains subword embeddings on raw text and groups related forms through combined cosine and n-gram similarity. This allows spelling and morphological diversity to be examined and analysed as linguistic structure rather than treated as noise. Using a large corpus of Luxembourgish user comments, the approach uncovers extensive lexical and orthographic variation that aligns with patterns described in dialectal and sociolinguistic research. The induced families capture systematic correspondences and highlight areas of regional and stylistic differentiation. The procedure does not strictly require manual annotation, but does produce transparent clusters that support both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results demonstrate that distributional modelling can reveal meaningful patterns of variation even in ''noisy'' or low-resource settings, offering a reproducible methodological framework for studying language variety in multilingual and small-language contexts.

### More Haste, Less Speed: Weaker Single-Layer Watermark Improves Distortion-Free Watermark Ensembles
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11793v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11793v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11793v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11793v1)

Watermarking has emerged as a crucial technique for detecting and attributing content generated by large language models. While recent advancements have utilized watermark ensembles to enhance robustness, prevailing methods typically prioritize maximizing the strength of the watermark at every individual layer. In this work, we identify a critical limitation in this "stronger-is-better" approach: strong watermarks significantly reduce the entropy of the token distribution, which paradoxically weakens the effectiveness of watermarking in subsequent layers. We theoretically and empirically show that detectability is bounded by entropy and that watermark ensembles induce a monotonic decrease in both entropy and the expected green-list ratio across layers. To address this inherent trade-off, we propose a general framework that utilizes weaker single-layer watermarks to preserve the entropy required for effective multi-layer ensembling. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this counter-intuitive strategy mitigates signal decay and consistently outperforms strong baselines in both detectability and robustness.

### Detecting RLVR Training Data via Structural Convergence of Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11792v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11792v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11792v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11792v1)

Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

### Beyond End-to-End Video Models: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Educational Video Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11790v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11790v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11790v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11790v1)

2026/02/12 10:14 GTM

Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

### TSR: Trajectory-Search Rollouts for Multi-Turn RL of LLM Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11767v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11767v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11767v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11767v1)

Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

### MiniCPM-SALA: Hybridizing Sparse and Linear Attention for Efficient Long-Context Modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11761v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11761v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11761v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11761v1)

The evolution of large language models (LLMs) towards applications with ultra-long contexts faces challenges posed by the high computational and memory costs of the Transformer architecture. While existing sparse and linear attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate these issues, they typically involve a trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance. This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints.

### Think Longer to Explore Deeper: Learn to Explore In-Context via Length-Incentivized Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11748v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11748v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11748v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11748v1)

Achieving effective test-time scaling requires models to engage in In-Context Exploration -- the intrinsic ability to generate, verify, and refine multiple reasoning hypotheses within a single continuous context.
  Grounded in State Coverage theory, our analysis identifies a critical bottleneck to enabling this capability: while broader state coverage requires longer reasoning trajectories, the probability of sampling such sequences decays exponentially during autoregressive generation, a phenomenon we term the ``Shallow Exploration Trap''.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Length-Incentivized Exploration(\method).
  This simple yet effective recipe explicitly encourages models to explore more via a length-based reward coupled with a redundancy penalty, thereby maximizing state coverage in two-step manner.
  Comprehensive experiments across different models (Qwen3, Llama) demonstrate that \method effectively incentivize in-context exploration.
  As a result, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.4\% on in-domain tasks and a 2.7\% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks.

### Mask What Matters: Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models with Object-Aligned Visual Contrastive Decoding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11737v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11737v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11737v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11737v1)

2026/02/12 09:04 GTM

We study object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve visual contrastive decoding (VCD) by constructing an object-aligned auxiliary view. We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass. Empirically, our method demonstrates consistent gains on two popular object hallucination benchmarks across two MLLMs.

### Thinking with Drafting: Optical Decompression via Logical Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11731v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11731v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11731v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11731v1)

2026/02/12 08:54 GTM

Existing multimodal large language models have achieved high-fidelity visual perception and exploratory visual generation. However, a precision paradox persists in complex reasoning tasks: optical perception systems transcribe symbols without capturing logical topology, while pixel-based generative models produce visual artifacts lacking mathematical exactness. To bridge this gap, we propose that reasoning over visual inputs be reconceptualized as optical decompression-the process of reconstructing latent logical structures from compressed visual tokens. Guided by the axiom that Parsing is Reasoning, we introduce Thinking with Drafting (TwD), which utilizes a minimalist Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as a grounding intermediate representation. Unlike standard approaches that hallucinate answers directly, TwD forces the model to draft its mental model into executable code, rendering deterministic visual proofs for self-verification. To validate this, we present VisAlg, a visual algebra benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that TwD serve as a superior cognitive scaffold. Our work establishes a closed-loop system where visual generation acts not as a creative output but as a logical verifier, offering a generalizable path for visual reasoning.

### DICE: Diffusion Large Language Models Excel at Generating CUDA Kernels
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11715v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11715v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11715v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11715v1)

Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, owing to their capacity for parallel token generation. This paradigm is particularly well-suited for code generation, where holistic structural planning and non-sequential refinement are critical. Despite this potential, tailoring dLLMs for CUDA kernel generation remains challenging, obstructed not only by the high specialization but also by the severe lack of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised fine-tuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose a bi-phase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of a CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, a series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Extensive experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale, establishing a new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation.

### Finding Sense in Nonsense with Generated Contexts: Perspectives from Humans and Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11699v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11699v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11699v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11699v1)

Nonsensical and anomalous sentences have been instrumental in the development of computational models of semantic interpretation. A core challenge is to distinguish between what is merely anomalous (but can be interpreted given a supporting context) and what is truly nonsensical. However, it is unclear (a) how nonsensical, rather than merely anomalous, existing datasets are; and (b) how well LLMs can make this distinction. In this paper, we answer both questions by collecting sensicality judgments from human raters and LLMs on sentences from five semantically deviant datasets: both context-free and when providing a context. We find that raters consider most sentences at most anomalous, and only a few as properly nonsensical. We also show that LLMs are substantially skilled in generating plausible contexts for anomalous cases.

### PatientHub: A Unified Framework for Patient Simulation

As Large Language Models increasingly power role-playing applications, simulating patients has become a valuable tool for training counselors and scaling therapeutic assessment. However, prior work is fragmented: existing approaches rely on incompatible, non-standardized data formats, prompts, and evaluation metrics, hindering reproducibility and fair comparison. In this paper, we introduce PatientHub, a unified and modular framework that standardizes the definition, composition, and deployment of simulated patients. To demonstrate PatientHub's utility, we implement several representative patient simulation methods as case studies, showcasing how our framework supports standardized cross-method evaluation and the seamless integration of custom evaluation metrics. We further demonstrate PatientHub's extensibility by prototyping two new simulator variants, highlighting how PatientHub accelerates method development by eliminating infrastructure overhead. By consolidating existing work into a single reproducible pipeline, PatientHub lowers the barrier to developing new simulation methods and facilitates cross-method and cross-model benchmarking. Our framework provides a practical foundation for future datasets, methods, and benchmarks in patient-centered dialogue, and the code is publicly available via https://github.com/Sahandfer/PatientHub.

### ThinkRouter: Efficient Reasoning via Routing Thinking between Latent and Discrete Spaces
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11683v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11683v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11683v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11683v1)

Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

### PhyNiKCE: A Neurosymbolic Agentic Framework for Autonomous Computational Fluid Dynamics
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11666v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11666v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11666v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11666v1)

The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

### Which Feedback Works for Whom? Differential Effects of LLM-Generated Feedback Elements Across Learner Profiles

Large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically generating feedback in education settings. However, it remains unclear how specific feedback elements, such as tone and information coverage, contribute to learning outcomes and learner acceptance, particularly across learners with different personality traits. In this study, we define six feedback elements and generate feedback for multiple-choice biology questions using GPT-5. We conduct a learning experiment with 321 first-year high school students and evaluate feedback effectiveness using two learning outcomes measures and subjective evaluations across six criteria. We further analyze differences in how feedback acceptance varies across learners based on Big Five personality traits. Our results show that effective feedback elements share common patterns supporting learning outcomes, while learners' subjective preferences differ across personality-based clusters. These findings highlight the importance of selecting and adapting feedback elements according to learners' personality traits when we design LLM-generated feedback, and provide practical implications for personalized feedback design in education.

### PACE: Prefix-Protected and Difficulty-Aware Compression for Efficient Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11639v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11639v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11639v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11639v1)

Language Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by scaling test-time computation but often suffer from ``overthinking'', producing excessively long reasoning traces that increase latency and memory usage. Existing LRMs typically enforce conciseness with uniform length penalties, which over-compress crucial early deduction steps at the sequence level and indiscriminately penalize all queries at the group level. To solve these limitations, we propose \textbf{\model}, a dual-level framework for prefix-protected and difficulty-aware compression under hierarchical supervision. At the sequence level, prefix-protected optimization employs decaying mixed rollouts to maintain valid reasoning paths while promoting conciseness. At the group level, difficulty-aware penalty dynamically scales length constraints based on query complexity, maintaining exploration for harder questions while curbing redundancy on easier ones. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen (1.5B/7B) demonstrate that \model achieves a substantial reduction in token usage (up to \textbf{55.7\%}) while simultaneously improving accuracy (up to \textbf{4.1\%}) on math benchmarks, with generalization ability to code, science, and general domains.

Intelligent devices have become deeply integrated into everyday life, generating vast amounts of user interactions that form valuable personal knowledge. Efficient organization of this knowledge in user memory is essential for enabling personalized applications. However, current research on memory writing, management, and reading using large language models (LLMs) faces challenges in filtering irrelevant information and in dealing with rising computational costs. Inspired by the concept of selective attention in the human brain, we introduce a memory discrimination task. To address large-scale interactions and diverse memory standards in this task, we propose a Scene-Aware Memory Discrimination method (SAMD), which comprises two key components: the Gating Unit Module (GUM) and the Cluster Prompting Module (CPM). GUM enhances processing efficiency by filtering out non-memorable interactions and focusing on the salient content most relevant to application demands. CPM establishes adaptive memory standards, guiding LLMs to discern what information should be remembered or discarded. It also analyzes the relationship between user intents and memory contexts to build effective clustering prompts. Comprehensive direct and indirect evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. We independently assess the performance of memory discrimination, showing that SAMD successfully recalls the majority of memorable data and remains robust in dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, when integrated into personalized applications, SAMD significantly enhances both the efficiency and quality of memory construction, leading to better organization of personal knowledge.

### Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment

The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.

The convergence of robotics and next-generation communication is a critical driver of technological advancement. As the world transitions from 5G to 6G, the foundational capabilities of wireless networks are evolving to support increasingly complex and autonomous robotic systems. This paper examines the transformative impact of 6G on enhancing key robotics functionalities. It provides a systematic mapping of IMT-2030 key performance indicators to robotic functional blocks including sensing, perception, cognition, actuation and self-learning. Building upon this mapping, we propose a high-level architectural framework integrating robotic, intelligent, and network service planes, underscoring the need for a holistic approach. As an example use case, we present a real-time, dynamic safety framework enabled by IMT-2030 capabilities for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared spaces.

### Any House Any Task: Scalable Long-Horizon Planning for Abstract Human Tasks

Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.

### LDA-1B: Scaling Latent Dynamics Action Model via Universal Embodied Data Ingestion

Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

### Sub--Riemannian boundary value problems for Optimal Geometric Locomotion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12199v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12199v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12199v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12199v1)

We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

### 3DGSNav: Enhancing Vision-Language Model Reasoning for Object Navigation via Active 3D Gaussian Splatting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12159v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12159v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12159v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12159v1)

Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/

### Multi Graph Search for High-Dimensional Robot Motion Planning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12096v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12096v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12096v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12096v1)

Efficient motion planning for high-dimensional robotic systems, such as manipulators and mobile manipulators, is critical for real-time operation and reliable deployment. Although advances in planning algorithms have enhanced scalability to high-dimensional state spaces, these improvements often come at the cost of generating unpredictable, inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources and memory. In this work, we introduce Multi-Graph Search (MGS), a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as the search progresses. We prove that MGS is complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks. Demonstrations, benchmarks and code are available at https://multi-graph-search.github.io/.

### Pack it in: Packing into Partially Filled Containers Through Contact

The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.

### RF-Modulated Adaptive Communication Improves Multi-Agent Robotic Exploration

Reliable coordination and efficient communication are critical challenges for multi-agent robotic exploration of environments where communication is limited. This work introduces Adaptive-RF Transmission (ART), a novel communication-aware planning algorithm that dynamically modulates transmission location based on signal strength and data payload size, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to share information efficiently without unnecessary backtracking. We further explore an extension to this approach called ART-SST, which enforces signal strength thresholds for high-fidelity data delivery. Through over 480 simulations across three cave-inspired environments, ART consistently outperforms existing strategies, including full rendezvous and minimum-signal heuristic approaches, achieving up to a 58% reduction in distance traveled and up to 52% faster exploration times compared to baseline methods. These results demonstrate that adaptive, payload-aware communication significantly improves coverage efficiency and mission speed in complex, communication-constrained environments, offering a promising foundation for future planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

### Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds: Self-Evolving Task Generation for Scalable Embodied Learning

Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.

### VLAW: Iterative Co-Improvement of Vision-Language-Action Policy and World Model

The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

### HoloBrain-0 Technical Report

2026/02/12 15:21 GTM

In this work, we introduce HoloBrain-0, a comprehensive Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that bridges the gap between foundation model research and reliable real-world robot deployment. The core of our system is a novel VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates robot embodiment priors, including multi-view camera parameters and kinematic descriptions (URDF), to enhance 3D spatial reasoning and support diverse embodiments. We validate this design through a scalable ``pre-train then post-train" paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art results on simulation benchmarks such as RoboTwin 2.0, LIBERO, and GenieSim, as well as strong results on challenging long-horizon real-world manipulation tasks. Notably, our efficient 0.2B-parameter variant rivals significantly larger baselines, enabling low-latency on-device deployment. To further accelerate research and practical adoption, we fully open-source the entire HoloBrain ecosystem, which includes: (1) powerful pre-trained VLA foundations; (2) post-trained checkpoints for multiple simulation suites and real-world tasks; and (3) RoboOrchard, a full-stack VLA infrastructure for data curation, model training and deployment. Together with standardized data collection protocols, this release provides the community with a complete, reproducible path toward high-performance robotic manipulation.

### Multi UAVs Preflight Planning in a Shared and Dynamic Airspace
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12055v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12055v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12055v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12055v1)

2026/02/12 15:18 GTM

Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

### Safety Beyond the Training Data: Robust Out-of-Distribution MPC via Conformalized System Level Synthesis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12047v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12047v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12047v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12047v1)

2026/02/12 15:11 GTM

We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.

### When would Vision-Proprioception Policies Fail in Robotic Manipulation?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12032v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12032v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12032v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12032v1)

2026/02/12 15:00 GTM

Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

### Adaptive-Horizon Conflict-Based Search for Closed-Loop Multi-Agent Path Finding

MAPF is a core coordination problem for large robot fleets in automated warehouses and logistics. Existing approaches are typically either open-loop planners, which generate fixed trajectories and struggle to handle disturbances, or closed-loop heuristics without reliable performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical deployments. This paper presents ACCBS, a closed-loop algorithm built on a finite-horizon variant of CBS with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC. ACCBS dynamically adjusts the planning horizon based on the available computational budget, and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons. As a result, it produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as the budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. Extensive case studies demonstrate that ACCBS combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment.

### Decentralized Multi-Robot Obstacle Detection and Tracking in a Maritime Scenario
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12012v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12012v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12012v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.12012v1)

Autonomous aerial-surface robot teams are promising for maritime monitoring. Robust deployment requires reliable perception over reflective water and scalable coordination under limited communication. We present a decentralized multi-robot framework for detecting and tracking floating containers using multiple UAVs cooperating with an autonomous surface vessel. Each UAV performs YOLOv8 and stereo-disparity-based visual detection, then tracks targets with per-object EKFs using uncertainty-aware data association. Compact track summaries are exchanged and fused conservatively via covariance intersection, ensuring consistency under unknown correlations. An information-driven assignment module allocates targets and selects UAV hover viewpoints by trading expected uncertainty reduction against travel effort and safety separation. Simulation results in a maritime scenario demonstrate improved coverage, localization accuracy, and tracking consistency while maintaining modest communication requirements.

### Accelerating Robotic Reinforcement Learning with Agent Guidance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11978v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11978v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11978v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11978v1)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.

### Robot-DIFT: Distilling Diffusion Features for Geometrically Consistent Visuomotor Control
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11934v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11934v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11934v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11934v1)

We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization.

Modeling vessel activity at sea is critical for a wide range of applications, including route planning, transportation logistics, maritime safety, and environmental monitoring. Over the past two decades, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has enabled real-time monitoring of hundreds of thousands of vessels, generating huge amounts of data daily. One major challenge in using AIS data is the presence of large gaps in vessel trajectories, often caused by coverage limitations or intentional transmission interruptions. These gaps can significantly degrade data quality, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete analysis. State-of-the-art imputation approaches have mainly been devised to tackle gaps in vehicle trajectories, even when the underlying road network is not considered. But the motion patterns of sailing vessels differ substantially, e.g., smooth turns, maneuvering near ports, or navigating in adverse weather conditions. In this application paper, we propose HABIT, a lightweight, configurable H3 Aggregation-Based Imputation framework for vessel Trajectories. This data-driven framework provides a valuable means to impute missing trajectory segments by extracting, analyzing, and indexing motion patterns from historical AIS data. Our empirical study over AIS data across various timeframes, densities, and vessel types reveals that HABIT produces maritime trajectory imputations performing comparably to baseline methods in terms of accuracy, while performing better in terms of latency while accounting for vessel characteristics and their motion patterns.

### Learning to Manipulate Anything: Revealing Data Scaling Laws in Bounding-Box Guided Policies
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11885v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11885v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11885v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11885v1)

Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation, posing a key obstacle to the deployment of real-world robots. This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

### Where Bits Matter in World Model Planning: A Paired Mixed-Bit Study for Efficient Spatial Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11882v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11882v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11882v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11882v1)

Efficient spatial reasoning requires world models that remain reliable under tight precision budgets. We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning. Code and run artifacts are available at https://github.com/suraj-ranganath/DINO-MBQuant.

### DiffPlace: Street View Generation via Place-Controllable Diffusion Model Enhancing Place Recognition

Generative models have advanced significantly in realistic image synthesis, with diffusion models excelling in quality and stability. Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition. Our results highlight the potential of generative models in enhancing scene-level and place-aware synthesis, providing a valuable approach for improving place recognition in autonomous driving

### LAMP: Implicit Language Map for Robot Navigation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11862v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11862v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11862v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11862v1)

Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

### JEPA-VLA: Video Predictive Embedding is Needed for VLA Models

Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

### HAIC: Humanoid Agile Object Interaction Control via Dynamics-Aware World Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11758v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11758v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11758v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11758v1)

Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.

### Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood Rewards for Multiagent Exploration
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11740v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11740v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11740v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11740v1)

Efficient exploration is critical for multiagent systems to discover coordinated strategies, particularly in open-ended domains such as search and rescue or planetary surveying. However, when exploration is encouraged only at the individual agent level, it often leads to redundancy, as agents act without awareness of how their teammates are exploring. In this work, we introduce Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) rewards, which score each agent's exploration by isolating its unique contribution to team exploration. Unlike prior methods that reward agents solely for the novelty of their individual observations, CCL emphasizes observations that are informative with respect to the joint exploration of the team. Experiments in continuous multiagent domains show that CCL rewards accelerate learning for domains with sparse team rewards, where most joint actions yield zero rewards, and are particularly effective in tasks that require tight coordination among agents.

### AC-MASAC: An Attentive Curriculum Learning Framework for Heterogeneous UAV Swarm Coordination

Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing the risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting. The proposed framework is validated on a custom multi-agent simulation platform, and the results show that our method has significant advantages over other advanced methods in terms of Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

### GSO-SLAM: Bidirectionally Coupled Gaussian Splatting and Direct Visual Odometry

We propose GSO-SLAM, a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that leverages Gaussian scene representation. Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy.

### LLM-Driven 3D Scene Generation of Agricultural Simulation Environments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11706v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11706v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11706v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11706v1)

Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

### Clutt3R-Seg: Sparse-view 3D Instance Segmentation for Language-grounded Grasping in Cluttered Scenes
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11660v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11660v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11660v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11660v1)

Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x. The code is available at: https://github.com/jeonghonoh/clutt3r-seg.

### SToRM: Supervised Token Reduction for Multi-modal LLMs toward efficient end-to-end autonomous driving
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11656v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11656v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11656v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11656v1)

In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.
  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

### Human-Like Gaze Behavior in Social Robots: A Deep Learning Approach Integrating Human and Non-Human Stimuli

Nonverbal behaviors, particularly gaze direction, play a crucial role in enhancing effective communication in social interactions. As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions. This work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts.

### ViTaS: Visual Tactile Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning for Visuomotor Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11643v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.11643v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11643v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.11643v1)

Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.
