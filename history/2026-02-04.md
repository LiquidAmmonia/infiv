### EventNeuS: 3D Mesh Reconstruction from a Single Event Camera
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03847v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03847v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03847v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03847v1)

Event cameras offer a considerable alternative to RGB cameras in many scenarios. While there are recent works on event-based novel-view synthesis, dense 3D mesh reconstruction remains scarcely explored and existing event-based techniques are severely limited in their 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this limitation, we present EventNeuS, a self-supervised neural model for learning 3D representations from monocular colour event streams. Our approach, for the first time, combines 3D signed distance function and density field learning with event-based supervision. Furthermore, we introduce spherical harmonics encodings into our model for enhanced handling of view-dependent effects. EventNeuS outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin, achieving 34% lower Chamfer distance and 31% lower mean absolute error on average compared to the best previous method.

### PrevizWhiz: Combining Rough 3D Scenes and 2D Video to Guide Generative Video Previsualization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03838v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03838v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03838v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03838v1)

In pre-production, filmmakers and 3D animation experts must rapidly prototype ideas to explore a film's possibilities before fullscale production, yet conventional approaches involve trade-offs in efficiency and expressiveness. Hand-drawn storyboards often lack spatial precision needed for complex cinematography, while 3D previsualization demands expertise and high-quality rigged assets. To address this gap, we present PrevizWhiz, a system that leverages rough 3D scenes in combination with generative image and video models to create stylized video previews. The workflow integrates frame-level image restyling with adjustable resemblance, time-based editing through motion paths or external video inputs, and refinement into high-fidelity video clips. A study with filmmakers demonstrates that our system lowers technical barriers for film-makers, accelerates creative iteration, and effectively bridges the communication gap, while also surfacing challenges of continuity, authorship, and ethical consideration in AI-assisted filmmaking.

### AutoFigure: Generating and Refining Publication-Ready Scientific Illustrations

High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.

### Continuous Control of Editing Models via Adaptive-Origin Guidance

Diffusion-based editing models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic image and video manipulation. However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets.

### Deep-learning-based pan-phenomic data reveals the explosive evolution of avian visual disparity
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03824v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03824v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03824v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03824v1)

The evolution of biological morphology is critical for understanding the diversity of the natural world, yet traditional analyses often involve subjective biases in the selection and coding of morphological traits. This study employs deep learning techniques, utilising a ResNet34 model capable of recognising over 10,000 bird species, to explore avian morphological evolution. We extract weights from the model's final fully connected (fc) layer and investigate the semantic alignment between the high-dimensional embedding space learned by the model and biological phenotypes. The results demonstrate that the high-dimensional embedding space encodes phenotypic convergence. Subsequently, we assess the morphological disparity among various taxa and evaluate the association between morphological disparity and species richness, demonstrating that species richness is the primary driver of morphospace expansion. Moreover, the disparity-through-time analysis reveals a visual "early burst" after the K-Pg extinction.
  While mainly aimed at evolutionary analysis, this study also provides insights into the interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. We demonstrate that hierarchical semantic structures (biological taxonomy) emerged in the high-dimensional embedding space despite being trained on flat labels. Furthermore, through adversarial examples, we provide evidence that our model in this task can overcome texture bias and learn holistic shape representations (body plans), challenging the prevailing view that CNNs rely primarily on local textures.

### Fast-Slow Efficient Training for Multimodal Large Language Models via Visual Token Pruning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03815v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03815v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03815v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03815v1)

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from severe training inefficiency issue, which is associated with their massive model sizes and visual token numbers. Existing efforts in efficient training focus on reducing model sizes or trainable parameters. Inspired by the success of Visual Token Pruning (VTP) in improving inference efficiency, we are exploring another substantial research direction for efficient training by reducing visual tokens. However, applying VTP at the training stage results in a training-inference mismatch: pruning-trained models perform poorly when inferring on non-pruned full visual token sequences. To close this gap, we propose DualSpeed, a fast-slow framework for efficient training of MLLMs. The fast-mode is the primary mode, which incorporates existing VTP methods as plugins to reduce visual tokens, along with a mode isolator to isolate the model's behaviors. The slow-mode is the auxiliary mode, where the model is trained on full visual sequences to retain training-inference consistency. To boost its training, it further leverages self-distillation to learn from the sufficiently trained fast-mode. Together, DualSpeed can achieve both training efficiency and non-degraded performance. Experiments show DualSpeed accelerates the training of LLaVA-1.5 by 2.1$\times$ and LLaVA-NeXT by 4.0$\times$, retaining over 99% performance. Code: https://github.com/dingkun-zhang/DualSpeed

### Progressive Checkerboards for Autoregressive Multiscale Image Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03811v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03811v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03811v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03811v1)

A key challenge in autoregressive image generation is to efficiently sample independent locations in parallel, while still modeling mutual dependencies with serial conditioning. Some recent works have addressed this by conditioning between scales in a multiscale pyramid. Others have looked at parallelizing samples in a single image using regular partitions or randomized orders. In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step. This enables effective conditioning both between and within scales. Intriguingly, we find evidence that in our balanced setting, a wide range of scale-up factors lead to similar results, so long as the total number of serial steps is constant. On class-conditional ImageNet, our method achieves competitive performance compared to recent state-of-the-art autoregressive systems with like model capacity, using fewer sampling steps.

### FullStack-Agent: Enhancing Agentic Full-Stack Web Coding via Development-Oriented Testing and Repository Back-Translation

Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become a popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The code is released at https://github.com/mnluzimu/FullStack-Agent.

### 3D-Aware Implicit Motion Control for View-Adaptive Human Video Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03796v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03796v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03796v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03796v1)

Existing methods for human motion control in video generation typically rely on either 2D poses or explicit 3D parametric models (e.g., SMPL) as control signals. However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors. Experiments confirm that 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality.

### BridgeV2W: Bridging Video Generation Models to Embodied World Models via Embodiment Masks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03793v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03793v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03793v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03793v1)

2026/02/03 17:56 GTM

Embodied world models have emerged as a promising paradigm in robotics, most of which leverage large-scale Internet videos or pretrained video generation models to enrich visual and motion priors. However, they still face key challenges: a misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoint, and non-unified architectures across embodiments. To this end, we present BridgeV2W, which converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks rendered from the URDF and camera parameters. These masks are then injected into a pretrained video generation model via a ControlNet-style pathway, which aligns the action control signals with predicted videos, adds view-specific conditioning to accommodate camera viewpoints, and yields a unified world model architecture across embodiments. To mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds, BridgeV2W further introduces a flow-based motion loss that focuses on learning dynamic and task-relevant regions. Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets, covering diverse and challenging conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, show that BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the potential of BridgeV2W on downstream real-world tasks, including policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning. More results can be found on our project website at https://BridgeV2W.github.io .

### From Pre- to Intra-operative MRI: Predicting Brain Shift in Temporal Lobe Resection for Epilepsy Surgery
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03785v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03785v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03785v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03785v1)

Introduction: In neurosurgery, image-guided Neurosurgery Systems (IGNS) highly rely on preoperative brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) to assist surgeons in locating surgical targets and determining surgical paths. However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients. Our contributions will be publicly available after acceptance in https://github.com/SurgicalDataScienceKCL/NeuralShift.

### QVLA: Not All Channels Are Equal in Vision-Language-Action Model's Quantization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03782v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03782v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03782v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03782v1)

The advent of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represents a significant leap for embodied intelligence, yet their immense computational demands critically hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware. Code will be released.

### FOVI: A biologically-inspired foveated interface for deep vision models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03766v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03766v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03766v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03766v1)

Human vision is foveated, with variable resolution peaking at the center of a large field of view; this reflects an efficient trade-off for active sensing, allowing eye-movements to bring different parts of the world into focus with other parts of the world in context. In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/nblauch/fovi and https://huggingface.co/fovi-pytorch.

### RAWDet-7: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Object Detection and Description on Quantized RAW Images
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03760v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03760v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03760v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03760v1)

Most vision models are trained on RGB images processed through ISP pipelines optimized for human perception, which can discard sensor-level information useful for machine reasoning. RAW images preserve unprocessed scene data, enabling models to leverage richer cues for both object detection and object description, capturing fine-grained details, spatial relationships, and contextual information often lost in processed images. To support research in this domain, we introduce RAWDet-7, a large-scale dataset of ~25k training and 7.6k test RAW images collected across diverse cameras, lighting conditions, and environments, densely annotated for seven object categories following MS-COCO and LVIS conventions. In addition, we provide object-level descriptions derived from the corresponding high-resolution sRGB images, facilitating the study of object-level information preservation under RAW image processing and low-bit quantization. The dataset allows evaluation under simulated 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization, reflecting realistic sensor constraints, and provides a benchmark for studying detection performance, description quality & detail, and generalization in low-bit RAW image processing. Dataset & code upon acceptance.

### Test-Time Conditioning with Representation-Aligned Visual Features
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03753v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03753v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03753v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03753v1)

2026/02/03 17:15 GTM

While representation alignment with self-supervised models has been shown to improve diffusion model training, its potential for enhancing inference-time conditioning remains largely unexplored. We introduce Representation-Aligned Guidance (REPA-G), a framework that leverages these aligned representations, with rich semantic properties, to enable test-time conditioning from features in generation. By optimizing a similarity objective (the potential) at inference, we steer the denoising process toward a conditioned representation extracted from a pre-trained feature extractor. Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens. We further extend this to multi-concept composition, allowing for the faithful combination of distinct concepts. REPA-G operates entirely at inference time, offering a flexible and precise alternative to often ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels. We theoretically justify how this guidance enables sampling from the potential-induced tilted distribution. Quantitative results on ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality, diverse generations. Code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/REPA-G.

### Zero-shot large vision-language model prompting for automated bone identification in paleoradiology x-ray archives
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03750v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03750v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03750v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03750v1)

2026/02/03 17:14 GTM

Paleoradiology, the use of modern imaging technologies to study archaeological and anthropological remains, offers new windows on millennial scale patterns of human health. Unfortunately, the radiographs collected during field campaigns are heterogeneous: bones are disarticulated, positioning is ad hoc, and laterality markers are often absent. Additionally, factors such as age at death, age of bone, sex, and imaging equipment introduce high variability. Thus, content navigation, such as identifying a subset of images with a specific projection view, can be time consuming and difficult, making efficient triaging a bottleneck for expert analysis. We report a zero shot prompting strategy that leverages a state of the art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically identify the main bone, projection view, and laterality in such images. Our pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone windowed PNGs, submits them to the LVLM with a carefully engineered prompt, and receives structured JSON outputs, which are extracted and formatted onto a spreadsheet in preparation for validation. On a random sample of 100 images reviewed by an expert board certified paleoradiologist, the system achieved 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, and 100% laterality accuracy, with low or medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases. These results suggest that LVLMs can substantially accelerate code word development for large paleoradiology datasets, allowing for efficient content navigation in future anthropology workflows.

### See-through: Single-image Layer Decomposition for Anime Characters
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03749v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03749v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03749v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03749v1)

2026/02/03 17:12 GTM

We introduce a framework that automates the transformation of static anime illustrations into manipulatable 2.5D models. Current professional workflows require tedious manual segmentation and the artistic ``hallucination'' of occluded regions to enable motion. Our approach overcomes this by decomposing a single image into fully inpainted, semantically distinct layers with inferred drawing orders. To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry. Our methodology couples a diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module, which enforces global geometric coherence, with a pixel-level pseudo-depth inference mechanism. This combination resolves the intricate stratification of anime characters, e.g., interleaving hair strands, allowing for dynamic layer reconstruction. We demonstrate that our approach yields high-fidelity, manipulatable models suitable for professional, real-time animation applications.

### LIVE: Long-horizon Interactive Video World Modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03747v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03747v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03747v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03747v1)

Autoregressive video world models predict future visual observations conditioned on actions. While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths.

### Edge-Optimized Vision-Language Models for Underground Infrastructure Assessment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03742v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03742v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03742v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03742v1)

Autonomous inspection of underground infrastructure, such as sewer and culvert systems, is critical to public safety and urban sustainability. Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios. Our results show the potential of edge-deployable integrated AI systems to bridge the gap between automated defect detection and actionable insights for infrastructure maintenance, paving the way for more scalable and autonomous inspection solutions.

Large vision-language models have achieved remarkable progress in visual reasoning, yet most existing systems rely on single-step or text-only reasoning, limiting their ability to iteratively refine understanding across multiple visual contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a new multi-round visual reasoning benchmark with training and test sets spanning both detection and segmentation tasks, enabling systematic evaluation under iterative reasoning scenarios. We further propose RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework that enforces grounded reasoning by requiring each reasoning trace to explicitly cite the corresponding reference bounding boxes, while maintaining semantic coherence via a global-local consistency reward. This reward extracts key objects and nouns from both global scene captions and region-level captions, aligning them with the reasoning trace to ensure consistency across reasoning steps. RegionReasoner is optimized with structured rewards combining grounding fidelity and global-local semantic alignment. Experiments on detection and segmentation tasks show that RegionReasoner-7B, together with our newly introduced benchmark RegionDial-Bench, considerably improves multi-round reasoning accuracy, spatial grounding precision, and global-local consistency, establishing a strong baseline for this emerging research direction.

### Referring Industrial Anomaly Segmentation

Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is vital for manufacturing, yet traditional methods face significant challenges: unsupervised approaches yield rough localizations requiring manual thresholds, while supervised methods overfit due to scarce, imbalanced data. Both suffer from the "One Anomaly Class, One Model" limitation. To address this, we propose Referring Industrial Anomaly Segmentation (RIAS), a paradigm leveraging language to guide detection. RIAS generates precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and uses universal prompts to detect diverse anomalies with a single model. We introduce the MVTec-Ref dataset to support this, designed with diverse referring expressions and focusing on anomaly patterns, notably with 95% small anomalies. We also propose the Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer (DQFormer) benchmark, enhanced by Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) to improve multi-scale segmentation. Unlike traditional methods using redundant queries, DQFormer employs only "Anomaly" and "Background" tokens for efficient visual-textual integration. Experiments demonstrate RIAS's effectiveness in advancing IAD toward open-set capabilities. Code: https://github.com/swagger-coder/RIAS-MVTec-Ref.

### Efficient Sequential Neural Network with Spatial-Temporal Attention and Linear LSTM for Robust Lane Detection Using Multi-Frame Images

Lane detection is a crucial perception task for all levels of automated vehicles (AVs) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, particularly in mixed-traffic environments where AVs must interact with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and challenging traffic scenarios. Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency. Relevant data, code, and models are released at https://doi.org/10.4121/4619cab6-ae4a-40d5-af77-582a77f3d821.

### MVP-LAM: Learning Action-Centric Latent Action via Cross-Viewpoint Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03668v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03668v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03668v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03668v1)

Learning \emph{latent actions} from diverse human videos enables scaling robot learning beyond embodiment-specific robot datasets, and these latent actions have recently been used as pseudo-action labels for vision-language-action (VLA) model pretraining. To make VLA pretraining effective, latent actions should contain information about the underlying agent's actions despite the absence of ground-truth labels. We propose \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew\textbf{P}oint \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}ction \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MVP-LAM}), which learns discrete latent actions that are highly informative about ground-truth actions from time-synchronized multi-view videos. MVP-LAM trains latent actions with a \emph{cross-viewpoint reconstruction} objective, so that a latent action inferred from one view must explain the future in another view, reducing reliance on viewpoint-specific cues. On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions, achieving higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on the SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks.

### MM-SCALE: Grounded Multimodal Moral Reasoning via Scalar Judgment and Listwise Alignment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03665v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03665v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03665v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03665v1)

2026/02/03 15:48 GTM

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) continue to struggle to make morally salient judgments in multimodal and socially ambiguous contexts. Prior works typically rely on binary or pairwise supervision, which often fail to capture the continuous and pluralistic nature of human moral reasoning. We present MM-SCALE (Multimodal Moral Scale), a large-scale dataset for aligning VLMs with human moral preferences through 5-point scalar ratings and explicit modality grounding. Each image-scenario pair is annotated with moral acceptability scores and grounded reasoning labels by humans using an interface we tailored for data collection, enabling listwise preference optimization over ranked scenario sets. By moving from discrete to scalar supervision, our framework provides richer alignment signals and finer calibration of multimodal moral reasoning. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned on MM-SCALE achieve higher ranking fidelity and more stable safety calibration than those trained with binary signals.

### SPWOOD: Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03634v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03634v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03634v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03634v1)

A consistent trend throughout the research of oriented object detection has been the pursuit of maintaining comparable performance with fewer and weaker annotations. This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VisionXLab/SPWOOD.

### Multi-Objective Optimization for Synthetic-to-Real Style Transfer
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03625v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03625v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03625v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03625v1)

Semantic segmentation networks require large amounts of pixel-level annotated data, which are costly to obtain for real-world images. Computer graphics engines can generate synthetic images alongside their ground-truth annotations. However, models trained on such images can perform poorly on real images due to the domain gap between real and synthetic images. Style transfer methods can reduce this difference by applying a realistic style to synthetic images. Choosing effective data transformations and their sequence is difficult due to the large combinatorial search space of style transfer operators. Using multi-objective genetic algorithms, we optimize pipelines to balance structural coherence and style similarity to target domains. We study the use of paired-image metrics on individual image samples during evolution to enable rapid pipeline evaluation, as opposed to standard distributional metrics that require the generation of many images. After optimization, we evaluate the resulting Pareto front using distributional metrics and segmentation performance. We apply this approach to standard datasets in synthetic-to-real domain adaptation: from the video game GTA5 to real image datasets Cityscapes and ACDC, focusing on adverse conditions. Results demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can propose diverse augmentation pipelines adapted to different objectives. The contribution of this work is the formulation of style transfer as a sequencing problem suitable for evolutionary optimization and the study of efficient metrics that enable feasible search in this space.

### Quasi-multimodal-based pathophysiological feature learning for retinal disease diagnosis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03622v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03622v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03622v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03622v1)

Retinal diseases spanning a broad spectrum can be effectively identified and diagnosed using complementary signals from multimodal data. However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks. The proposed learning system is thoroughly interpreted through visualizations in both image and feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in the tasks of multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy:0.842, Kappa: 0.861). This work not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of retinal disease screening but also offers a scalable framework for data augmentation across various medical imaging modalities.

### KTV: Keyframes and Key Tokens Selection for Efficient Training-Free Video LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03615v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03615v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03615v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03615v1)

2026/02/03 15:08 GTM

Training-free video understanding leverages the strong image comprehension capabilities of pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) by treating a video as a sequence of static frames, thus obviating the need for costly video-specific training. However, this paradigm often suffers from severe visual redundancy and high computational overhead, especially when processing long videos. Crucially, existing keyframe selection strategies, especially those based on CLIP similarity, are prone to biases and may inadvertently overlook critical frames, resulting in suboptimal video comprehension. To address these significant challenges, we propose \textbf{KTV}, a novel two-stage framework for efficient and effective training-free video understanding. In the first stage, KTV performs question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level visual features, yielding a compact, diverse, and representative subset of frames that mitigates temporal redundancy. In the second stage, KTV applies key visual token selection, pruning redundant or less informative tokens from each selected keyframe based on token importance and redundancy, which significantly reduces the number of tokens fed into the LLM. Extensive experiments on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task demonstrate that KTV outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines while using significantly fewer visual tokens, \emph{e.g.}, only 504 visual tokens for a 60-min video with 10800 frames, achieving $44.8\%$ accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark. In particular, KTV also exceeds several training-based approaches on certain benchmarks.

### A Lightweight Library for Energy-Based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03604v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03604v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03604v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03604v1)

2026/02/03 14:56 GTM

We present EB-JEPA, an open-source library for learning representations and world models using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs). JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/eb_jepa.

### Refer-Agent: A Collaborative Multi-Agent System with Reasoning and Reflection for Referring Video Object Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03595v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03595v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03595v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03595v1)

2026/02/03 14:48 GTM

Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos based on textual queries. Current methods mainly rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, this paradigm suffers from heavy data dependence and limited scalability against the rapid evolution of MLLMs. Although recent zero-shot approaches offer a flexible alternative, their performance remains significantly behind SFT-based methods, due to the straightforward workflow designs. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Refer-Agent}, a collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms. This system decomposes RVOS into step-by-step reasoning process. During reasoning, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine frame selection strategy to ensure the frame diversity and textual relevance, along with a Dynamic Focus Layout that adaptively adjusts the agent's visual focus. Furthermore, we propose a Chain-of-Reflection mechanism, which employs a Questioner-Responder pair to generate a self-reflection chain, enabling the system to verify intermediate results and generates feedback for next-round reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate that Refer-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including both SFT-based models and zero-shot approaches. Moreover, Refer-Agent is flexible and enables fast integration of new MLLMs without any additional fine-tuning costs. Code will be released.

### TIPS Over Tricks: Simple Prompts for Effective Zero-shot Anomaly Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03594v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03594v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03594v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03594v1)

Anomaly detection identifies departures from expected behavior in safety-critical settings. When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior work compensates with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlooks the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture. Code is available at github.com/AlirezaSalehy/Tipsomaly.

### High-Resolution Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection: GBU-UCOD Dataset and Topology-Aware and Frequency-Decoupled Networks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03591v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03591v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03591v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03591v1)

Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) is a challenging task due to the extreme visual similarity between targets and backgrounds across varying marine depths. Existing methods often struggle with topological fragmentation of slender creatures in the deep sea and the subtle feature extraction of transparent organisms. In this paper, we propose DeepTopo-Net, a novel framework that integrates topology-aware modeling with frequency-decoupled perception. To address physical degradation, we design the Water-Conditioned Adaptive Perceptor (WCAP), which employs Riemannian metric tensors to dynamically deform convolutional sampling fields. Furthermore, the Abyssal-Topology Refinement Module (ATRM) is developed to maintain the structural connectivity of spindly targets through skeletal priors. Specifically, we first introduce GBU-UCOD, the first high-resolution (2K) benchmark tailored for marine vertical zonation, filling the data gap for hadal and abyssal zones. Extensive experiments on MAS3K, RMAS, and our proposed GBU-UCOD datasets demonstrate that DeepTopo-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving the morphological integrity of complex underwater patterns. The datasets and codes will be released at https://github.com/Wuwenji18/GBU-UCOD.

### SlowFocus: Enhancing Fine-grained Temporal Understanding in Video LLM
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03589v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03589v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03589v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03589v1)

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text understanding, which has paved the way for their expansion into video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to analyze video data. However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism across both existing public video understanding benchmarks and our proposed FineAction-CGR.

### ELIQ: A Label-Free Framework for Quality Assessment of Evolving AI-Generated Images

Generative text-to-image models are advancing at an unprecedented pace, continuously shifting the perceptual quality ceiling and rendering previously collected labels unreliable for newer generations. To address this, we present ELIQ, a Label-free Framework for Quality Assessment of Evolving AI-generated Images. Specifically, ELIQ focuses on visual quality and prompt-image alignment, automatically constructs positive and aspect-specific negative pairs to cover both conventional distortions and AIGC-specific distortion modes, enabling transferable supervision without human annotations. Building on these pairs, ELIQ adapts a pre-trained multimodal model into a quality-aware critic via instruction tuning and predicts two-dimensional quality using lightweight gated fusion and a Quality Query Transformer. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ELIQ consistently outperforms existing label-free methods, generalizes from AI-generated content (AIGC) to user-generated content (UGC) scenarios without modification, and paves the way for scalable and label-free quality assessment under continuously evolving generative models. The code will be released upon publication.

### Cut to the Mix: Simple Data Augmentation Outperforms Elaborate Ones in Limited Organ Segmentation Datasets
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03555v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03555v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03555v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03555v1)

Multi-organ segmentation is a widely applied clinical routine and automated organ segmentation tools dramatically improve the pipeline of the radiologists. Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images. Our implementation is publicly available for future benchmarks.

### AffordanceGrasp-R1:Leveraging Reasoning-Based Affordance Segmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Grasping
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03547v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03547v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03547v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03547v1)

2026/02/03 14:00 GTM

We introduce AffordanceGrasp-R1, a reasoning-driven affordance segmentation framework for robotic grasping that combines a chain-of-thought (CoT) cold-start strategy with reinforcement learning to enhance deduction and spatial grounding. In addition, we redesign the grasping pipeline to be more context-aware by generating grasp candidates from the global scene point cloud and subsequently filtering them using instruction-conditioned affordance masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordanceGrasp-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on benchmark datasets, and real-world robotic grasping evaluations further validate its robustness and generalization under complex language-conditioned manipulation scenarios.

### Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03538v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03538v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03538v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03538v1)

2026/02/03 13:53 GTM

While Dynamic Gaussian Splatting enables high-fidelity 4D reconstruction, its deployment is severely hindered by a fundamental dilemma: unconstrained densification leads to excessive memory consumption incompatible with edge devices, whereas heuristic pruning fails to achieve optimal rendering quality under preset Gaussian budgets. In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### PnP-U3D: Plug-and-Play 3D Framework Bridging Autoregression and Diffusion for Unified Understanding and Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03533v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03533v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03533v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03533v1)

The rapid progress of large multimodal models has inspired efforts toward unified frameworks that couple understanding and generation. While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, while also excelling in 3D editing tasks. These results highlight the potential of unified AR+diffusion models as a promising direction for building more general-purpose 3D intelligence.

### Robust Representation Learning in Masked Autoencoders

Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) achieve impressive performance in image classification tasks, yet the internal representations they learn remain less understood. This work started as an attempt to understand the strong downstream classification performance of MAE. In this process we discover that representations learned with the pretraining and fine-tuning, are quite robust - demonstrating a good classification performance in the presence of degradations, such as blur and occlusions. Through layer-wise analysis of token embeddings, we show that pretrained MAE progressively constructs its latent space in a class-aware manner across network depth: embeddings from different classes lie in subspaces that become increasingly separable. We further observe that MAE exhibits early and persistent global attention across encoder layers, in contrast to standard Vision Transformers (ViTs). To quantify feature robustness, we introduce two sensitivity indicators: directional alignment between clean and perturbed embeddings, and head-wise retention of active features under degradations. These studies help establish the robust classification performance of MAEs.

### Interpretable Logical Anomaly Classification via Constraint Decomposition and Instruction Fine-Tuning

Logical anomalies are violations of predefined constraints on object quantity, spatial layout, and compositional relationships in industrial images. While prior work largely treats anomaly detection as a binary decision, such formulations cannot indicate which logical rule is broken and therefore offer limited value for quality assurance. We introduce Logical Anomaly Classification (LAC), a task that unifies anomaly detection and fine-grained violation classification in a single inference step. To tackle LAC, we propose LogiCls, a vision-language framework that decomposes complex logical constraints into a sequence of verifiable subqueries. We further present a data-centric instruction synthesis pipeline that generates chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision for these subqueries, coupling precise grounding annotations with diverse image-text augmentations to adapt vision language models (VLMs) to logic-sensitive reasoning. Training is stabilized by a difficulty-aware resampling strategy that emphasizes challenging subqueries and long tail constraint types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogiCls delivers robust, interpretable, and accurate industrial logical anomaly classification, providing both the predicted violation categories and their evidence trails.

### Semantic Routing: Exploring Multi-Layer LLM Feature Weighting for Diffusion Transformers
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03510v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03510v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03510v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03510v1)

Recent DiT-based text-to-image models increasingly adopt LLMs as text encoders, yet text conditioning remains largely static and often utilizes only a single LLM layer, despite pronounced semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and non-stationary denoising dynamics over both diffusion time and network depth. To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning.

### Decoupling Skeleton and Flesh: Efficient Multimodal Table Reasoning with Disentangled Alignment and Structure-aware Guidance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03491v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03491v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03491v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03491v1)

Reasoning over table images remains challenging for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to complex layouts and tightly coupled structure-content information. Existing solutions often depend on expensive supervised training, reinforcement learning, or external tools, limiting efficiency and scalability. This work addresses a key question: how to adapt LVLMs to table reasoning with minimal annotation and no external tools? Specifically, we first introduce DiSCo, a Disentangled Structure-Content alignment framework that explicitly separates structural abstraction from semantic grounding during multimodal alignment, efficiently adapting LVLMs to tables structures. Building on DiSCo, we further present Table-GLS, a Global-to-Local Structure-guided reasoning framework that performs table reasoning via structured exploration and evidence-grounded inference. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework efficiently enhances LVLM's table understanding and reasoning capabilities, particularly generalizing to unseen table structures.

### Scaling Continual Learning with Bi-Level Routing Mixture-of-Experts
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03473v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03473v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03473v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03473v1)

2026/02/03 12:45 GTM

Continual learning, especially class-incremental learning (CIL), on the basis of a pre-trained model (PTM) has garnered substantial research interest in recent years. However, how to effectively learn both discriminative and comprehensive feature representations while maintaining stability and plasticity over very long task sequences remains an open problem. We propose CaRE, a scalable {C}ontinual Le{a}rner with efficient Bi-Level {R}outing Mixture-of-{E}xperts (BR-MoE). The core idea of BR-MoE is a bi-level routing mechanism: a router selection stage that dynamically activates relevant task-specific routers, followed by an expert routing phase that dynamically activates and aggregates experts, aiming to inject discriminative and comprehensive representations into every intermediate network layer. On the other hand, we introduce a challenging evaluation protocol for comprehensively assessing CIL methods across very long task sequences spanning hundreds of tasks. Extensive experiments show that CaRE demonstrates leading performance across a variety of datasets and task settings, including commonly used CIL datasets with classical CIL settings (e.g., 5-20 tasks). To the best of our knowledge, CaRE is the first continual learner that scales to very long task sequences (ranging from 100 to over 300 non-overlapping tasks), while outperforming all baselines by a large margin on such task sequences. Code will be publicly released at https://github.com/LMMMEng/CaRE.git.

### Inlier-Centric Post-Training Quantization for Object Detection Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03472v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03472v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03472v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03472v1)

Object detection is pivotal in computer vision, yet its immense computational demands make deployment slow and power-hungry, motivating quantization. However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples. Experiments on the COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection.

### Contextualized Visual Personalization in Vision-Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03454v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03454v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03454v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03454v1)

2026/02/03 12:21 GTM

Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches often fail to generate personalized responses based on the user's specific experiences, as they lack the ability to associate visual inputs with a user's accumulated visual-textual context. We newly formalize this challenge as contextualized visual personalization, which requires the visual recognition and textual retrieval of personalized visual experiences by VLMs when interpreting new images. To address this issue, we propose CoViP, a unified framework that treats personalized image captioning as a core task for contextualized visual personalization and improves this capability through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation. We further introduce diagnostic evaluations that explicitly rule out textual shortcut solutions and verify whether VLMs truly leverage visual context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that existing open-source and proprietary VLMs exhibit substantial limitations, while CoViP not only improves personalized image captioning but also yields holistic gains across downstream personalization tasks. These results highlight CoViP as a crucial stage for enabling robust and generalizable contextualized visual personalization.

### Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance for Multi-Subject Image Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03448v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03448v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03448v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03448v1)

2026/02/03 12:13 GTM

Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize images that faithfully preserve the identities of multiple reference subjects while following textual instructions. However, existing methods often suffer from identity inconsistency and limited compositional control, as they rely on diffusion models to implicitly associate text prompts with reference images. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG), a framework that provides explicit, structured supervision from high-level concepts to fine-grained appearances. At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This module restricts each text token to attend only to its matched reference regions, ensuring precise attribute binding and reliable multi-subject composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-subject image generation, substantially improving prompt following and subject consistency.

### HetroD: A High-Fidelity Drone Dataset and Benchmark for Autonomous Driving in Heterogeneous Traffic
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03447v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03447v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03447v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03447v1)

2026/02/03 12:12 GTM

We present HetroD, a dataset and benchmark for developing autonomous driving systems in heterogeneous environments. HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

### ConsistentRFT: Reducing Visual Hallucinations in Flow-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03425v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03425v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03425v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03425v1)

2026/02/03 11:49 GTM

Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on flow-based models is crucial for preference alignment. However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistentRFT significantly mitigates visual hallucinations, achieving average reductions of 49\% for low-level and 38\% for high-level perceptual hallucinations. Furthermore, ConsistentRFT outperforms other RFT methods on out-of-domain metrics, showing an improvement of 5.1\% (v.s. the baseline's decrease of -0.4\%) over FLUX1.dev.

### Origin Lens: A Privacy-First Mobile Framework for Cryptographic Image Provenance and AI Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03423v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03423v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03423v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03423v1)

2026/02/03 11:49 GTM

The proliferation of generative AI poses challenges for information integrity assurance, requiring systems that connect model governance with end-user verification. We present Origin Lens, a privacy-first mobile framework that targets visual disinformation through a layered verification architecture. Unlike server-side detection systems, Origin Lens performs cryptographic image provenance verification and AI detection locally on the device via a Rust/Flutter hybrid architecture. Our system integrates multiple signals - including cryptographic provenance, generative model fingerprints, and optional retrieval-augmented verification - to provide users with graded confidence indicators at the point of consumption. We discuss the framework's alignment with regulatory requirements (EU AI Act, DSA) and its role in verification infrastructure that complements platform-level mechanisms.

### Socratic-Geo: Synthetic Data Generation and Geometric Reasoning via Multi-Agent Interaction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03414v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03414v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03414v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03414v1)

2026/02/03 11:42 GTM

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced vision-language understanding. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle with geometric reasoning, revealing a critical bottleneck: the extreme scarcity of high-quality image-text pairs. Human annotation is prohibitively expensive, while automated methods fail to ensure fidelity and training effectiveness. Existing approaches either passively adapt to available images or employ inefficient random exploration with filtering, decoupling generation from learning needs. We propose Socratic-Geo, a fully autonomous framework that dynamically couples data synthesis with model learning through multi-agent interaction. The Teacher agent generates parameterized Python scripts with reflective feedback (Reflect for solvability, RePI for visual validity), ensuring image-text pair purity. The Solver agent optimizes reasoning through preference learning, with failure paths guiding Teacher's targeted augmentation. Independently, the Generator learns image generation capabilities on accumulated "image-code-instruction" triplets, distilling programmatic drawing intelligence into visual generation. Starting from only 108 seed problems, Socratic-Solver achieves 49.11 on six benchmarks using one-quarter of baseline data, surpassing strong baselines by 2.43 points. Socratic-Generator achieves 42.4% on GenExam, establishing new state-of-the-art for open-source models, surpassing Seedream-4.0 (39.8%) and approaching Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image (43.1%).

### UnHype: CLIP-Guided Hypernetworks for Dynamic LoRA Unlearning

Recent advances in large-scale diffusion models have intensified concerns about their potential misuse, particularly in generating realistic yet harmful or socially disruptive content. This challenge has spurred growing interest in effective machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing specific knowledge or concepts from a model without compromising its overall generative capabilities. Among various approaches, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning models toward targeted unlearning. However, LoRA-based methods often exhibit limited adaptability to concept semantics and struggle to balance removing closely related concepts with maintaining generalization across broader meanings. Moreover, these methods face scalability challenges when multiple concepts must be erased simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce UnHype, a framework that incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training. The proposed architecture can be directly plugged into Stable Diffusion as well as modern flow-based text-to-image models, where it demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on the CLIP embedding, enabling more context-aware, scalable unlearning. We evaluate UnHype across several challenging tasks, including object erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content removal, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

### From Vicious to Virtuous Cycles: Synergistic Representation Learning for Unsupervised Video Object-Centric Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03390v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03390v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03390v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03390v1)

2026/02/03 11:11 GTM

Unsupervised object-centric learning models, particularly slot-based architectures, have shown great promise in decomposing complex scenes. However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot. By bridging the representational gap between the encoder and decoder, SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/hynnsk/SRL.

### Seeing Through the Chain: Mitigate Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning Models via CoT Compression and Contrastive Preference Optimization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03380v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03380v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03380v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03380v1)

While multimodal reasoning models (MLRMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities, they remain prone to hallucinations, and effective solutions are still underexplored. In this paper, we experimentally analyze the hallucination cause and propose C3PO, a training-based mitigation framework comprising \textbf{C}hain-of-Thought \textbf{C}ompression and \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization. Firstly, we identify that introducing reasoning mechanisms exacerbates models' reliance on language priors while overlooking visual inputs, which can produce CoTs with reduced visual cues but redundant text tokens. To this end, we propose to selectively filter redundant thinking tokens for a more compact and signal-efficient CoT representation that preserves task-relevant information while suppressing noise. In addition, we observe that the quality of the reasoning trace largely determines whether hallucination emerges in subsequent responses. To leverage this insight, we introduce a reasoning-enhanced preference tuning scheme that constructs training pairs using high-quality AI feedback. We further design a multimodal hallucination-inducing mechanism that elicits models' inherent hallucination patterns via carefully crafted inducers, yielding informative negative signals for contrastive correction. We provide theoretical justification for the effectiveness and demonstrate consistent hallucination reduction across diverse MLRMs and benchmarks.

### PlanTRansformer: Unified Prediction and Planning with Goal-conditioned Transformer
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03376v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03376v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03376v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03376v1)

Trajectory prediction and planning are fundamental yet disconnected components in autonomous driving. Prediction models forecast surrounding agent motion under unknown intentions, producing multimodal distributions, while planning assumes known ego objectives and generates deterministic trajectories. This mismatch creates a critical bottleneck: prediction lacks supervision for agent intentions, while planning requires this information. Existing prediction models, despite strong benchmarking performance, often remain disconnected from planning constraints such as collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. We introduce Plan TRansformer (PTR), a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. A teacher-student training strategy progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable. PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to the baseline Motion Transformer (MTR) and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer. The architecture-agnostic design enables application to diverse Transformer-based prediction models. Project Website: https://github.com/SelzerConst/PlanTRansformer

### Unifying Watermarking via Dimension-Aware Mapping
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03373v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03373v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03373v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03373v1)

2026/02/03 10:49 GTM

Deep watermarking methods often share similar encoder-decoder architectures, yet differ substantially in their functional behaviors. We propose DiM, a new multi-dimensional watermarking framework that formulates watermarking as a dimension-aware mapping problem, thereby unifying existing watermarking methods at the functional level. Under DiM, watermark information is modeled as payloads of different dimensionalities, including one-dimensional binary messages, two-dimensional spatial masks, and three-dimensional spatiotemporal structures. We find that the dimensional configuration of embedding and extraction largely determines the resulting watermarking behavior. Same-dimensional mappings preserve payload structure and support fine-grained control, while cross-dimensional mappings enable spatial or spatiotemporal localization. We instantiate DiM in the video domain, where spatiotemporal representations enable a broader set of dimension mappings. Experiments demonstrate that varying only the embedding and extraction dimensions, without architectural changes, leads to different watermarking capabilities, including spatiotemporal tamper localization, local embedding control, and recovery of temporal order under frame disruptions.

### SLIM-Diff: Shared Latent Image-Mask Diffusion with Lp loss for Data-Scarce Epilepsy FLAIR MRI
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03372v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03372v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03372v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03372v1)

2026/02/03 10:48 GTM

Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) lesions in epilepsy FLAIR MRI are subtle and scarce, making joint image--mask generative modeling prone to instability and memorization. We propose SLIM-Diff, a compact joint diffusion model whose main contributions are (i) a single shared-bottleneck U-Net that enforces tight coupling between anatomy and lesion geometry from a 2-channel image+mask representation, and (ii) loss-geometry tuning via a tunable $L_p$ objective. As an internal baseline, we include the canonical DDPM-style objective ($ε$-prediction with $L_2$ loss) and isolate the effect of prediction parameterization and $L_p$ geometry under a matched setup. Experiments show that $x_0$-prediction is consistently the strongest choice for joint synthesis, and that fractional sub-quadratic penalties ($L_{1.5}$) improve image fidelity while $L_2$ better preserves lesion mask morphology. Our code and model weights are available in https://github.com/MarioPasc/slim-diff

### Multi-Resolution Alignment for Voxel Sparsity in Camera-Based 3D Semantic Scene Completion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03371v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03371v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03371v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03371v1)

2026/02/03 10:46 GTM

Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) offers a cost-effective solution for assessing the geometric occupancy and semantic labels of each voxel in the surrounding 3D scene with image inputs, providing a voxel-level scene perception foundation for the perception-prediction-planning autonomous driving systems. Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ICST-MIPL/MRA_TIP.

### Symbol-Aware Reasoning with Masked Discrete Diffusion for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03370v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03370v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03370v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03370v1)

2026/02/03 10:46 GTM

Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) requires reasoning over diverse symbols and 2D structural layouts, yet autoregressive models struggle with exposure bias and syntactic inconsistency. We present a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates HMER as iterative symbolic refinement instead of sequential generation. Through multi-step remasking, the proposal progressively refines both symbols and structural relations, removing causal dependencies and improving structural consistency. A symbol-aware tokenization and Random-Masking Mutual Learning further enhance syntactic alignment and robustness to handwriting diversity. On the MathWriting benchmark, the proposal achieves 5.56\% CER and 60.42\% EM, outperforming strong Transformer and commercial baselines. Consistent gains on CROHME 2014--2023 demonstrate that discrete diffusion provides a new paradigm for structure-aware visual recognition beyond generative modeling.

### Z3D: Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding from Images

3D visual grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in a 3D scene based on natural language queries. In this work, we explore zero-shot 3DVG from multi-view images alone, without requiring any geometric supervision or object priors. We introduce Z3D, a universal grounding pipeline that flexibly operates on multi-view images while optionally incorporating camera poses and depth maps. We identify key bottlenecks in prior zero-shot methods causing significant performance degradation and address them with (i) a state-of-the-art zero-shot 3D instance segmentation method to generate high-quality 3D bounding box proposals and (ii) advanced reasoning via prompt-based segmentation, which utilizes full capabilities of modern VLMs. Extensive experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot methods.

Text-conditioned diffusion models have advanced image and video super-resolution by using prompts as semantic priors, but modern super-resolution pipelines typically rely on latent tiling to scale to high resolutions, where a single global caption causes prompt underspecification. A coarse global prompt often misses localized details (prompt sparsity) and provides locally irrelevant guidance (prompt misguidance) that can be amplified by classifier-free guidance. We propose Tiled Prompts, a unified framework for image and video super-resolution that generates a tile-specific prompt for each latent tile and performs super-resolution under locally text-conditioned posteriors, providing high-information guidance that resolves prompt underspecification with minimal overhead. Experiments on high resolution real-world images and videos show consistent gains in perceptual quality and text alignment, while reducing hallucinations and tile-level artifacts relative to global-prompt baselines.

### Composable Visual Tokenizers with Generator-Free Diagnostics of Learnability

We introduce CompTok, a training framework for learning visual tokenizers whose tokens are enhanced for compositionality. CompTok uses a token-conditioned diffusion decoder. By employing an InfoGAN-style objective, where we train a recognition model to predict the tokens used to condition the diffusion decoder using the decoded images, we enforce the decoder to not ignore any of the tokens. To promote compositional control, besides the original images, CompTok also trains on tokens formed by swapping token subsets between images, enabling more compositional control of the token over the decoder. As the swapped tokens between images do not have ground truth image targets, we apply a manifold constraint via an adversarial flow regularizer to keep unpaired swap generations on the natural-image distribution. The resulting tokenizer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on image class-conditioned generation, but also demonstrates properties such as swapping tokens between images to achieve high level semantic editing of an image. Additionally, we propose two metrics that measures the landscape of the token space that can be useful to describe not only the compositionality of the tokens, but also how easy to learn the landscape is for a generator to be trained on this space. We show in experiments that CompTok can improve on both of the metrics as well as supporting state-of-the-art generators for class conditioned generation.

### PWAVEP: Purifying Imperceptible Adversarial Perturbations in 3D Point Clouds via Spectral Graph Wavelets
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03333v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03333v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03333v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03333v1)

Recent progress in adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds, particularly in achieving spatial imperceptibility and high attack performance, presents significant challenges for defenders. Current defensive approaches remain cumbersome, often requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training procedures or auxiliary data access. To address these threats, in this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and non-invasive defense mechanism in the spectral domain, grounded in a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between imperceptible perturbations and high-frequency spectral components. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel purification framework, termed PWAVEP, which begins by computing a spectral graph wavelet domain saliency score and local sparsity score for each point. Guided by these values, PWAVEP adopts a hierarchical strategy, it eliminates the most salient points, which are identified as hardly recoverable adversarial outliers. Simultaneously, it applies a spectral filtering process to a broader set of moderately salient points. This process leverages a graph wavelet transform to attenuate high-frequency coefficients associated with the targeted points, thereby effectively suppressing adversarial noise. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PWAVEP achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud purification.

Novel view synthesis has evolved rapidly, advancing from Neural Radiance Fields to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which offers real-time rendering and rapid training without compromising visual fidelity. However, 3DGS relies heavily on accurate camera poses and high-quality point cloud initialization, which are difficult to obtain in sparse-view scenarios. While traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) pipelines often fail in these settings, existing learning-based point estimation alternatives typically require reliable reference views and remain sensitive to pose or depth errors. In this work, we propose a robust method utilizing π^3, a reference-free point cloud estimation network. We integrate dense initialization from π^3 with a regularization scheme designed to mitigate geometric inaccuracies. Specifically, we employ uncertainty-guided depth supervision, normal consistency loss, and depth warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Tanks and Temples, LLFF, DTU, and MipNeRF360 datasets.

### MedSAM-Agent: Empowering Interactive Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-turn Agentic Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03320v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03320v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03320v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03320v1)

Medical image segmentation is evolving from task-specific models toward generalizable frameworks. Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization. Code is available \href{https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/MedSAM-Agent}{here}.

### Invisible Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks for Generative Data Augmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03316v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03316v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03316v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03316v1)

With the rapid advancement of image generative models, generative data augmentation has become an effective way to enrich training images, especially when only small-scale datasets are available. At the same time, in practical applications, generative data augmentation can be vulnerable to clean-label backdoor attacks, which aim to bypass human inspection. However, based on theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, we observe that directly applying existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attack methods (e.g., COMBAT) to generated images results in low attack success rates. This motivates us to move beyond pixel-level triggers and focus instead on the latent feature level. To this end, we propose InvLBA, an invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation by latent perturbation. We theoretically prove that the generalization of the clean accuracy and attack success rates of InvLBA can be guaranteed. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our method improves the attack success rate by 46.43% on average, with almost no reduction in clean accuracy and high robustness against SOTA defense methods.

### PQTNet: Pixel-wise Quantitative Thermography Neural Network for Estimating Defect Depth in Polylactic Acid Parts by Additive Manufacturing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03314v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03314v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03314v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03314v1)

Defect depth quantification in additively manufactured (AM) components remains a significant challenge for non-destructive testing (NDT). This study proposes a Pixel-wise Quantitative Thermography Neural Network (PQT-Net) to address this challenge for polylactic acid (PLA) parts. A key innovation is a novel data augmentation strategy that reconstructs thermal sequence data into two-dimensional stripe images, preserving the complete temporal evolution of heat diffusion for each pixel. The PQT-Net architecture incorporates a pre-trained EfficientNetV2-S backbone and a custom Residual Regression Head (RRH) with learnable parameters to refine outputs. Comparative experiments demonstrate the superiority of PQT-Net over other deep learning models, achieving a minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0094 mm and a coefficient of determination (R) exceeding 99%. The high precision of PQT-Net underscores its potential for robust quantitative defect characterization in AM.

### RDT2: Exploring the Scaling Limit of UMI Data Towards Zero-Shot Cross-Embodiment Generalization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03310v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03310v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03310v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03310v1)

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold promise for generalist robotics but currently struggle with data scarcity, architectural inefficiencies, and the inability to generalize across different hardware platforms. We introduce RDT2, a robotic foundation model built upon a 7B parameter VLM designed to enable zero-shot deployment on novel embodiments for open-vocabulary tasks. To achieve this, we collected one of the largest open-source robotic datasets--over 10,000 hours of demonstrations in diverse families--using an enhanced, embodiment-agnostic Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI). Our approach employs a novel three-stage training recipe that aligns discrete linguistic knowledge with continuous control via Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), flow-matching, and distillation for real-time inference. Consequently, RDT2 becomes one of the first models that simultaneously zero-shot generalizes to unseen objects, scenes, instructions, and even robotic platforms. Besides, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in dexterous, long-horizon, and dynamic downstream tasks like playing table tennis. See https://rdt-robotics.github.io/rdt2/ for more information.

### Full end-to-end diagnostic workflow automation of 3D OCT via foundation model-driven AI for retinal diseases
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03302v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03302v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03302v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03302v1)

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionized retinal disease diagnosis with its high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging nature, yet its full diagnostic automation in clinical practices remains constrained by multi-stage workflows and conventional single-slice single-task AI models. We present Full-process OCT-based Clinical Utility System (FOCUS), a foundation model-driven framework enabling end-to-end automation of 3D OCT retinal disease diagnosis. FOCUS sequentially performs image quality assessment with EfficientNetV2-S, followed by abnormality detection and multi-disease classification using a fine-tuned Vision Foundation Model. Crucially, FOCUS leverages a unified adaptive aggregation method to intelligently integrate 2D slices-level predictions into comprehensive 3D patient-level diagnosis. Trained and tested on 3,300 patients (40,672 slices), and externally validated on 1,345 patients (18,498 slices) across four different-tier centers and diverse OCT devices, FOCUS achieved high F1 scores for quality assessment (99.01%), abnormally detection (97.46%), and patient-level diagnosis (94.39%). Real-world validation across centers also showed stable performance (F1: 90.22%-95.24%). In human-machine comparisons, FOCUS matched expert performance in abnormality detection (F1: 95.47% vs 90.91%) and multi-disease diagnosis (F1: 93.49% vs 91.35%), while demonstrating better efficiency. FOCUS automates the image-to-diagnosis pipeline, representing a critical advance towards unmanned ophthalmology with a validated blueprint for autonomous screening to enhance population scale retinal care accessibility and efficiency.

### R1-SyntheticVL: Is Synthetic Data from Generative Models Ready for Multimodal Large Language Model?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03300v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03300v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03300v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03300v1)

In this work, we aim to develop effective data synthesis techniques that autonomously synthesize multimodal training data for enhancing MLLMs in solving complex real-world tasks. To this end, we propose Collective Adversarial Data Synthesis (CADS), a novel and general approach to synthesize high-quality, diverse and challenging multimodal data for MLLMs. The core idea of CADS is to leverage collective intelligence to ensure high-quality and diverse generation, while exploring adversarial learning to synthesize challenging samples for effectively driving model improvement. Specifically, CADS operates with two cyclic phases, i.e., Collective Adversarial Data Generation (CAD-Generate) and Collective Adversarial Data Judgment (CAD-Judge). CAD-Generate leverages collective knowledge to jointly generate new and diverse multimodal data, while CAD-Judge collaboratively assesses the quality of synthesized data. In addition, CADS introduces an Adversarial Context Optimization mechanism to optimize the generation context to encourage challenging and high-value data generation. With CADS, we construct MMSynthetic-20K and train our model R1-SyntheticVL, which demonstrates superior performance on various benchmarks.

### POP: Prefill-Only Pruning for Efficient Large Model Inference
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03295v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03295v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03295v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03295v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, their deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. Existing structured pruning methods, while hardware-efficient, often suffer from significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we argue that this failure stems from a stage-agnostic pruning approach that overlooks the asymmetric roles between the prefill and decode stages. By introducing a virtual gate mechanism, our importance analysis reveals that deep layers are critical for next-token prediction (decode) but largely redundant for context encoding (prefill). Leveraging this insight, we propose Prefill-Only Pruning (POP), a stage-aware inference strategy that safely omits deep layers during the computationally intensive prefill stage while retaining the full model for the sensitive decode stage. To enable the transition between stages, we introduce independent Key-Value (KV) projections to maintain cache integrity, and a boundary handling strategy to ensure the accuracy of the first generated token. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1, Qwen3-VL, and Gemma-3 across diverse modalities demonstrate that POP achieves up to 1.37$\times$ speedup in prefill latency with minimal performance loss, effectively overcoming the accuracy-efficiency trade-off limitations of existing structured pruning methods.

### LEVIO: Lightweight Embedded Visual Inertial Odometry for Resource-Constrained Devices
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03294v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03294v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03294v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03294v1)

Accurate, infrastructure-less sensor systems for motion tracking are essential for mobile robotics and augmented reality (AR) applications. The most popular state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems, however, are too computationally demanding for resource-constrained hardware, such as micro-drones and smart glasses. This work presents LEVIO, a fully featured VIO pipeline optimized for ultra-low-power compute platforms, allowing six-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) real-time sensing. LEVIO incorporates established VIO components such as Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature tracking and bundle adjustment, while emphasizing a computationally efficient architecture with parallelization and low memory usage to suit embedded microcontrollers and low-power systems-on-chip (SoCs). The paper proposes and details the algorithmic design choices and the hardware-software co-optimization approach, and presents real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware. LEVIO is validated on a parallel-processing ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, achieving 20 FPS while consuming less than 100 mW, and benchmarked against public VIO datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility and adoption, the complete implementation is released as open-source.

### A3-TTA: Adaptive Anchor Alignment Test-Time Adaptation for Image Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03292v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03292v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03292v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03292v1)

2026/02/03 09:18 GTM

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a practical solution for deploying image segmentation models under domain shift without accessing source data or retraining. Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose \textbf{A3-TTA}, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures. A3-TTA also excels in continual TTA, maintaining high performance across sequential target domains with strong anti-forgetting ability. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/A3-TTA.

### Time Is All It Takes: Spike-Retiming Attacks on Event-Driven Spiking Neural Networks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03284v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03284v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03284v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03284v1)

2026/02/03 09:06 GTM

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) compute with discrete spikes and exploit temporal structure, yet most adversarial attacks change intensities or event counts instead of timing. We study a timing-only adversary that retimes existing spikes while preserving spike counts and amplitudes in event-driven SNNs, thus remaining rate-preserving. We formalize a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with a unified trio of budgets: per-spike jitter $\mathcal{B}_{\infty}$, total delay $\mathcal{B}_{1}$, and tamper count $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Feasible adversarial examples must satisfy timeline consistency and non-overlap, which makes the search space discrete and constrained. To optimize such retimings at scale, we use projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization: shift-probability logits yield a differentiable soft retiming for backpropagation, and a strict projection in the forward pass produces a feasible discrete schedule that satisfies capacity-1, non-overlap, and the chosen budget at every step. The objective maximizes task loss on the projected input and adds a capacity regularizer together with budget-aware penalties, which stabilizes gradients and aligns optimization with evaluation. Across event-driven benchmarks (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST) and diverse SNN architectures, we evaluate under binary and integer event grids and a range of retiming budgets, and also test models trained with timing-aware adversarial training designed to counter timing-only attacks. For example, on DVS-Gesture the attack attains high success (over $90\%$) while touching fewer than $2\%$ of spikes under $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Taken together, our results show that spike retiming is a practical and stealthy attack surface that current defenses struggle to counter, providing a clear reference for temporal robustness in event-driven SNNs. Code is available at https://github.com/yuyi-sd/Spike-Retiming-Attacks.

### Global Geometry Is Not Enough for Vision Representations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03282v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03282v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03282v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03282v1)

A common assumption in representation learning is that globally well-distributed embeddings support robust and generalizable representations. This focus has shaped both training objectives and evaluation protocols, implicitly treating global geometry as a proxy for representational competence. While global geometry effectively encodes which elements are present, it is often insensitive to how they are composed. We investigate this limitation by testing the ability of geometric metrics to predict compositional binding across 21 vision encoders. We find that standard geometry-based statistics exhibit near-zero correlation with compositional binding. In contrast, functional sensitivity, as measured by the input-output Jacobian, reliably tracks this capability. We further provide an analytic account showing that this disparity arises from objective design, as existing losses explicitly constrain embedding geometry but leave the local input-output mapping unconstrained. These results suggest that global embedding geometry captures only a partial view of representational competence and establish functional sensitivity as a critical complementary axis for modeling composite structure.

### HypCBC: Domain-Invariant Hyperbolic Cross-Branch Consistency for Generalizable Medical Image Analysis

Robust generalization beyond training distributions remains a critical challenge for deep neural networks. This is especially pronounced in medical image analysis, where data is often scarce and covariate shifts arise from different hardware devices, imaging protocols, and heterogeneous patient populations. These factors collectively hinder reliable performance and slow down clinical adoption. Despite recent progress, existing learning paradigms primarily rely on the Euclidean manifold, whose flat geometry fails to capture the complex, hierarchical structures present in clinical data. In this work, we exploit the advantages of hyperbolic manifolds to model complex data characteristics. We present the first comprehensive validation of hyperbolic representation learning for medical image analysis and demonstrate statistically significant gains across eleven in-distribution datasets and three ViT models. We further propose an unsupervised, domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed method promotes domain-invariant features and outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean methods by an average of $+2.1\%$ AUC on three domain generalization benchmarks: Fitzpatrick17k, Camelyon17-WILDS, and a cross-dataset setup for retinal imaging. These datasets span different imaging modalities, data sizes, and label granularities, confirming generalization capabilities across substantially different conditions.

### LaVPR: Benchmarking Language and Vision for Place Recognition

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) often fails under extreme environmental changes and perceptual aliasing. Furthermore, standard systems cannot perform "blind" localization from verbal descriptions alone, a capability needed for applications such as emergency response. To address these challenges, we introduce LaVPR, a large-scale benchmark that extends existing VPR datasets with over 650,000 rich natural-language descriptions. Using LaVPR, we investigate two paradigms: Multi-Modal Fusion for enhanced robustness and Cross-Modal Retrieval for language-based localization. Our results show that language descriptions yield consistent gains in visually degraded conditions, with the most significant impact on smaller backbones. Notably, adding language allows compact models to rival the performance of much larger vision-only architectures. For cross-modal retrieval, we establish a baseline using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Multi-Similarity loss, which substantially outperforms standard contrastive methods across vision-language models. Ultimately, LaVPR enables a new class of localization systems that are both resilient to real-world stochasticity and practical for resource-constrained deployment. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/oferidan1/LaVPR.

### InstaDrive: Instance-Aware Driving World Models for Realistic and Consistent Video Generation

Autonomous driving relies on robust models trained on high-quality, large-scale multi-view driving videos. While world models offer a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving videos, they struggle to maintain instance-level temporal consistency and spatial geometric fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose InstaDrive, a novel framework that enhances driving video realism through two key advancements: (1) Instance Flow Guider, which extracts and propagates instance features across frames to enforce temporal consistency, preserving instance identity over time. (2) Spatial Geometric Aligner, which improves spatial reasoning, ensures precise instance positioning, and explicitly models occlusion hierarchies. By incorporating these instance-aware mechanisms, InstaDrive achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality and enhances downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset. Additionally, we utilize CARLA's autopilot to procedurally and stochastically simulate rare but safety-critical driving scenarios across diverse maps and regions, enabling rigorous safety evaluation for autonomous systems.

### EventFlash: Towards Efficient MLLMs for Event-Based Vision
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03230v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03230v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03230v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03230v1)

Event-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable robust perception in high-speed and low-light scenarios, addressing key limitations of frame-based MLLMs. However, current event-based MLLMs often rely on dense image-like processing paradigms, overlooking the spatiotemporal sparsity of event streams and resulting in high computational cost. In this paper, we propose EventFlash, a novel and efficient MLLM to explore spatiotemporal token sparsification for reducing data redundancy and accelerating inference. Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues. Finally, a sparse density-guided attention module is designed to improve spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing empty or sparse areas. Experimental results show that EventFlash achieves a $12.4\times$ throughput improvement over the baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance. It supports long-range event stream processing with up to 1,000 bins, significantly outperforming the 5-bin limit of EventGPT. We believe EventFlash serves as an efficient foundation model for event-based vision.

### Spiral RoPE: Rotate Your Rotary Positional Embeddings in the 2D Plane
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03227v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03227v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03227v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03227v1)

2026/02/03 07:56 GTM

Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is the de facto positional encoding in large language models due to its ability to encode relative positions and support length extrapolation. When adapted to vision transformers, the standard axial formulation decomposes two-dimensional spatial positions into horizontal and vertical components, implicitly restricting positional encoding to axis-aligned directions. We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes. Across a wide range of vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation, Spiral RoPE consistently improves performance. Qualitative analysis of attention maps further show that Spiral RoPE exhibits more concentrated activations on semantically relevant objects and better respects local object boundaries, highlighting the importance of multi-directional positional encoding in vision transformers.

### PokeFusion Attention: Enhancing Reference-Free Style-Conditioned Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03220v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03220v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03220v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03220v1)

This paper studies reference-free style-conditioned character generation in text-to-image diffusion models, where high-quality synthesis requires both stable character structure and consistent, fine-grained style expression across diverse prompts. Existing approaches primarily rely on text-only prompting, which is often under-specified for visual style and tends to produce noticeable style drift and geometric inconsistency, or introduce reference-based adapters that depend on external images at inference time, increasing architectural complexity and limiting deployment flexibility.We propose PokeFusion Attention, a lightweight decoder-level cross-attention mechanism that fuses textual semantics with learned style embeddings directly inside the diffusion decoder. By decoupling text and style conditioning at the attention level, our method enables effective reference-free stylized generation while keeping the pretrained diffusion backbone fully frozen.PokeFusion Attention trains only decoder cross-attention layers together with a compact style projection module, resulting in a parameter-efficient and plug-and-play control component that can be easily integrated into existing diffusion pipelines and transferred across different backbones.Experiments on a stylized character generation benchmark (Pokemon-style) demonstrate that our method consistently improves style fidelity, semantic alignment, and character shape consistency compared with representative adapter-based baselines, while maintaining low parameter overhead and inference-time simplicity.

### FARTrack: Fast Autoregressive Visual Tracking with High Performance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03214v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03214v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03214v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03214v1)

Inference speed and tracking performance are two critical evaluation metrics in the field of visual tracking. However, high-performance trackers often suffer from slow processing speeds, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To alleviate this issue, we propose FARTrack, a Fast Auto-Regressive Tracking framework. Since autoregression emphasizes the temporal nature of the trajectory sequence, it can maintain high performance while achieving efficient execution across various devices. FARTrack introduces Task-Specific Self-Distillation and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification, designed from the perspectives of shallow-yet-accurate distillation and redundant-to-essential token optimization, respectively. Task-Specific Self-Distillation achieves model compression by distilling task-specific tokens layer by layer, enhancing the model's inference speed while avoiding suboptimal manual teacher-student layer pairs assignments. Meanwhile, Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification sequentially condenses multiple templates, avoiding additional runtime overhead while learning a temporally-global optimal sparsification strategy. FARTrack demonstrates outstanding speed and competitive performance. It delivers an AO of 70.6% on GOT-10k in real-time. Beyond, our fastest model achieves a speed of 343 FPS on the GPU and 121 FPS on the CPU.

### ConsisDrive: Identity-Preserving Driving World Models for Video Generation by Instance Mask
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03213v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03213v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03213v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03213v1)

Autonomous driving relies on robust models trained on large-scale, high-quality multi-view driving videos. Although world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving data, they often suffer from identity drift, where the same object changes its appearance or category across frames due to the absence of instance-level temporal constraints. We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity. By integrating these mechanisms, ConsisDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving video generation quality and demonstrates significant improvements in downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

### VIRAL: Visual In-Context Reasoning via Analogy in Diffusion Transformers
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03210v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03210v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03210v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03210v1)

Replicating In-Context Learning (ICL) in computer vision remains challenging due to task heterogeneity. We propose \textbf{VIRAL}, a framework that elicits visual reasoning from a pre-trained image editing model by formulating ICL as conditional generation via visual analogy ($x_s : x_t :: x_q : y_q$). We adapt a frozen Diffusion Transformer (DiT) using role-aware multi-image conditioning and introduce a Mixture-of-Experts LoRA to mitigate gradient interference across diverse tasks. Additionally, to bridge the gaps in current visual context datasets, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning perception, restoration, and editing. Experiments demonstrate that VIRAL outperforms existing methods, validating that a unified V-ICL paradigm can handle the majority of visual tasks, including open-domain editing. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VIRAL-744A

### Spectral Evolution Search: Efficient Inference-Time Scaling for Reward-Aligned Image Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03208v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03208v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03208v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03208v1)

2026/02/03 07:19 GTM

Inference-time scaling offers a versatile paradigm for aligning visual generative models with downstream objectives without parameter updates. However, existing approaches that optimize the high-dimensional initial noise suffer from severe inefficiency, as many search directions exert negligible influence on the final generation. We show that this inefficiency is closely related to a spectral bias in generative dynamics: model sensitivity to initial perturbations diminishes rapidly as frequency increases. Building on this insight, we propose Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a plug-and-play framework for initial noise optimization that executes gradient-free evolutionary search within a low-frequency subspace. Theoretically, we derive the Spectral Scaling Prediction from perturbation propagation dynamics, which explains the systematic differences in the impact of perturbations across frequencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SES significantly advances the Pareto frontier of generation quality versus computational cost, consistently outperforming strong baselines under equivalent budgets.

### WebSplatter: Enabling Cross-Device Efficient Gaussian Splatting in Web Browsers via WebGPU
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03207v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03207v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03207v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03207v1)

2026/02/03 07:18 GTM

We present WebSplatter, an end-to-end GPU rendering pipeline for the heterogeneous web ecosystem. Unlike naive ports, WebSplatter introduces a wait-free hierarchical radix sort that circumvents the lack of global atomics in WebGPU, ensuring deterministic execution across diverse hardware. Furthermore, we propose an opacity-aware geometry culling stage that dynamically prunes splats before rasterization, significantly reducing overdraw and peak memory footprint. Evaluation demonstrates that WebSplatter consistently achieves 1.2$\times$ to 4.5$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art web viewers.

### Hand3R: Online 4D Hand-Scene Reconstruction in the Wild

For Embodied AI, jointly reconstructing dynamic hands and the dense scene context is crucial for understanding physical interaction. However, most existing methods recover isolated hands in local coordinates, overlooking the surrounding 3D environment. To address this, we present Hand3R, the first online framework for joint 4D hand-scene reconstruction from monocular video. Hand3R synergizes a pre-trained hand expert with a 4D scene foundation model via a scene-aware visual prompting mechanism. By injecting high-fidelity hand priors into a persistent scene memory, our approach enables simultaneous reconstruction of accurate hand meshes and dense metric-scale scene geometry in a single forward pass. Experiments demonstrate that Hand3R bypasses the reliance on offline optimization and delivers competitive performance in both local hand reconstruction and global positioning.

### From Single Scan to Sequential Consistency: A New Paradigm for LIDAR Relocalization

LiDAR relocalization aims to estimate the global 6-DoF pose of a sensor in the environment. However, existing regression-based approaches are prone to dynamic or ambiguous scenarios, as they either solely rely on single-frame inference or neglect the spatio-temporal consistency across scans. In this paper, we propose TempLoc, a new LiDAR relocalization framework that enhances the robustness of localization by effectively modeling sequential consistency. Specifically, a Global Coordinate Estimation module is first introduced to predict point-wise global coordinates and associated uncertainties for each LiDAR scan. A Prior Coordinate Generation module is then presented to estimate inter-frame point correspondences by the attention mechanism. Lastly, an Uncertainty-Guided Coordinate Fusion module is deployed to integrate both predictions of point correspondence in an end-to-end fashion, yielding a more temporally consistent and accurate global 6-DoF pose. Experimental results on the NCLT and Oxford Robot-Car benchmarks show that our TempLoc outperforms stateof-the-art methods by a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal-aware correspondence modeling in LiDAR relocalization. Our code will be released soon.

### LSGQuant: Layer-Sensitivity Guided Quantization for One-Step Diffusion Real-World Video Super-Resolution
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03182v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03182v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03182v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03182v1)

One-Step Diffusion Models have demonstrated promising capability and fast inference in video super-resolution (VSR) for real-world. Nevertheless, the substantial model size and high computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) limit downstream applications. While low-bit quantization is a common approach for model compression, the effectiveness of quantized models is challenged by the high dynamic range of input latent and diverse layer behaviors. To deal with these challenges, we introduce LSGQuant, a layer-sensitivity guided quantizing approach for one-step diffusion-based real-world VSR. Our method incorporates a Dynamic Range Adaptive Quantizer (DRAQ) to fit video token activations. Furthermore, we estimate layer sensitivity and implement a Variance-Oriented Layer Training Strategy (VOLTS) by analyzing layer-wise statistics in calibration. We also introduce Quantization-Aware Optimization (QAO) to jointly refine the quantized branch and a retained high-precision branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has nearly performance to origin model with full-precision and significantly exceeds existing quantization techniques. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/LSGQuant.

### BinaryDemoire: Moiré-Aware Binarization for Image Demoiréing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03176v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03176v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03176v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03176v1)

Image demoiréing aims to remove structured moiré artifacts in recaptured imagery, where degradations are highly frequency-dependent and vary across scales and directions. While recent deep networks achieve high-quality restoration, their full-precision designs remain costly for deployment. Binarization offers an extreme compression regime by quantizing both activations and weights to 1-bit. Yet, it has been rarely studied for demoiréing and performs poorly when naively applied. In this work, we propose BinaryDemoire, a binarized demoiréing framework that explicitly accommodates the frequency structure of moiré degradations. First, we introduce a moiré-aware binary gate (MABG) that extracts lightweight frequency descriptors together with activation statistics. It predicts channel-wise gating coefficients to condition the aggregation of binary convolution responses. Second, we design a shuffle-grouped residual adapter (SGRA) that performs structured sparse shortcut alignment. It further integrates interleaved mixing to promote information exchange across different channel partitions. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BinaryDemoire surpasses current binarization methods. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/BinaryDemoire.

### Human-in-the-loop Adaptation in Group Activity Feature Learning for Team Sports Video Retrieval
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03157v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03157v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03157v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03157v1)

2026/02/03 06:15 GTM

This paper proposes human-in-the-loop adaptation for Group Activity Feature Learning (GAFL) without group activity annotations. This human-in-the-loop adaptation is employed in a group-activity video retrieval framework to improve its retrieval performance. Our method initially pre-trains the GAF space based on the similarity of group activities in a self-supervised manner, unlike prior work that classifies videos into pre-defined group activity classes in a supervised learning manner. Our interactive fine-tuning process updates the GAF space to allow a user to better retrieve videos similar to query videos given by the user. In this fine-tuning, our proposed data-efficient video selection process provides several videos, which are selected from a video database, to the user in order to manually label these videos as positive or negative. These labeled videos are used to update (i.e., fine-tune) the GAF space, so that the positive and negative videos move closer to and farther away from the query videos through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive experimental results on two team sports datasets validate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance. Ablation studies also demonstrate that several components in our human-in-the-loop adaptation contribute to the improvement of the retrieval performance.

### Fully Kolmogorov-Arnold Deep Model in Medical Image Segmentation

Deeply stacked KANs are practically impossible due to high training difficulties and substantial memory requirements. Consequently, existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the comprehensive exploration of KANs. This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to directly deeply stacked KAN, ALL U-KAN achieves 10 times reduction in parameter count and reduces memory consumption by more than 20 times, unlocking the new explorations into deep KAN architectures.

### Diversity-Preserved Distribution Matching Distillation for Fast Visual Synthesis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03139v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03139v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03139v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03139v1)

Distribution matching distillation (DMD) aligns a multi-step generator with its few-step counterpart to enable high-quality generation under low inference cost. However, DMD tends to suffer from mode collapse, as its reverse-KL formulation inherently encourages mode-seeking behavior, for which existing remedies typically rely on perceptual or adversarial regularization, thereby incurring substantial computational overhead and training instability. In this work, we propose a role-separated distillation framework that explicitly disentangles the roles of distilled steps: the first step is dedicated to preserving sample diversity via a target-prediction (e.g., v-prediction) objective, while subsequent steps focus on quality refinement under the standard DMD loss, with gradients from the DMD objective blocked at the first step. We term this approach Diversity-Preserved DMD (DP-DMD), which, despite its simplicity -- no perceptual backbone, no discriminator, no auxiliary networks, and no additional ground-truth images -- preserves sample diversity while maintaining visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods in extensive text-to-image experiments.

### FSOD-VFM: Few-Shot Object Detection with Vision Foundation Models and Graph Diffusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03137v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03137v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03137v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03137v1)

2026/02/03 05:45 GTM

In this paper, we present FSOD-VFM: Few-Shot Object Detectors with Vision Foundation Models, a framework that leverages vision foundation models to tackle the challenge of few-shot object detection. FSOD-VFM integrates three key components: a universal proposal network (UPN) for category-agnostic bounding box generation, SAM2 for accurate mask extraction, and DINOv2 features for efficient adaptation to new object categories. Despite the strong generalization capabilities of foundation models, the bounding boxes generated by UPN often suffer from overfragmentation, covering only partial object regions and leading to numerous small, false-positive proposals rather than accurate, complete object detections. To address this issue, we introduce a novel graph-based confidence reweighting method. In our approach, predicted bounding boxes are modeled as nodes in a directed graph, with graph diffusion operations applied to propagate confidence scores across the network. This reweighting process refines the scores of proposals, assigning higher confidence to whole objects and lower confidence to local, fragmented parts. This strategy improves detection granularity and effectively reduces the occurrence of false-positive bounding box proposals. Through extensive experiments on Pascal-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$, and CD-FSOD datasets, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance without requiring additional training. Notably, on the challenging CD-FSOD dataset, which spans multiple datasets and domains, our FSOD-VFM achieves 31.6 AP in the 10-shot setting, substantially outperforming previous training-free methods that reach only 21.4 AP. Code is available at: https://intellindust-ai-lab.github.io/projects/FSOD-VFM.

### SwiftVLM: Efficient Vision-Language Model Inference via Cross-Layer Token Bypass
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03134v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03134v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03134v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03134v1)

Visual token pruning is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of vision-language models (VLMs), and existing methods often rely on early pruning decisions to improve efficiency. While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior.

### FinMTM: A Multi-Turn Multimodal Benchmark for Financial Reasoning and Agent Evaluation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03130v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03130v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03130v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03130v1)

The financial domain poses substantial challenges for vision-language models (VLMs) due to specialized chart formats and knowledge-intensive reasoning requirements. However, existing financial benchmarks are largely single-turn and rely on a narrow set of question formats, limiting comprehensive evaluation in realistic application scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FinMTM, a multi-turn multimodal benchmark that expands diversity along both data and task dimensions. On the data side, we curate and annotate 11{,}133 bilingual (Chinese and English) financial QA pairs grounded in financial visuals, including candlestick charts, statistical plots, and report figures. On the task side, FinMTM covers single- and multiple-choice questions, multi-turn open-ended dialogues, and agent-based tasks. We further design task-specific evaluation protocols, including a set-overlap scoring rule for multiple-choice questions, a weighted combination of turn-level and session-level scores for multi-turn dialogues, and a composite metric that integrates planning quality with final outcomes for agent tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation of 22 VLMs reveal their limitations in fine-grained visual perception, long-context reasoning, and complex agent workflows.

### Parallel-Probe: Towards Efficient Parallel Thinking via 2D Probing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03845v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03845v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03845v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03845v1)

Parallel thinking has emerged as a promising paradigm for reasoning, yet it imposes significant computational burdens. Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probing, an interface that exposes the width-depth dynamics of parallel thinking by periodically eliciting intermediate answers from all branches. Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic scaling across width-depth allocations, heterogeneous reasoning branch lengths, and early stabilization of global consensus. Guided by these insights, we introduce $\textbf{Parallel-Probe}$, a training-free controller designed to optimize online parallel thinking. Parallel-Probe employs consensus-based early stopping to regulate reasoning depth and deviation-based branch pruning to dynamically adjust width. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and multiple models demonstrate that Parallel-Probe establishes a superior Pareto frontier for test-time scaling. Compared to standard majority voting, it reduces sequential tokens by up to $\textbf{35.8}$% and total token cost by over $\textbf{25.8}$% while maintaining competitive accuracy.

### Accelerating Scientific Research with Gemini: Case Studies and Common Techniques

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for accelerating scientific research. While models are increasingly capable of assisting with routine tasks, their ability to contribute to novel, expert-level mathematical discovery is less understood. We present a collection of case studies demonstrating how researchers have successfully collaborated with advanced AI models, specifically Google's Gemini-based models (in particular Gemini Deep Think and its advanced variants), to solve open problems, refute conjectures, and generate new proofs across diverse areas in theoretical computer science, as well as other areas such as economics, optimization, and physics. Based on these experiences, we extract common techniques for effective human-AI collaboration in theoretical research, such as iterative refinement, problem decomposition, and cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer. While the majority of our results stem from this interactive, conversational methodology, we also highlight specific instances that push beyond standard chat interfaces. These include deploying the model as a rigorous adversarial reviewer to detect subtle flaws in existing proofs, and embedding it within a "neuro-symbolic" loop that autonomously writes and executes code to verify complex derivations. Together, these examples highlight the potential of AI not just as a tool for automation, but as a versatile, genuine partner in the creative process of scientific discovery.

### AutoFigure: Generating and Refining Publication-Ready Scientific Illustrations

High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.

### They Said Memes Were Harmless-We Found the Ones That Hurt: Decoding Jokes, Symbols, and Cultural References
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03822v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03822v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03822v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03822v1)

Meme-based social abuse detection is challenging because harmful intent often relies on implicit cultural symbolism and subtle cross-modal incongruence. Prior approaches, from fusion-based methods to in-context learning with Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), have made progress but remain limited by three factors: i) cultural blindness (missing symbolic context), ii) boundary ambiguity (satire vs. abuse confusion), and iii) lack of interpretability (opaque model reasoning). We introduce CROSS-ALIGN+, a three-stage framework that systematically addresses these limitations: (1) Stage I mitigates cultural blindness by enriching multimodal representations with structured knowledge from ConceptNet, Wikidata, and Hatebase; (2) Stage II reduces boundary ambiguity through parameter-efficient LoRA adapters that sharpen decision boundaries; and (3) Stage III enhances interpretability by generating cascaded explanations. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks and eight LVLMs demonstrate that CROSS-ALIGN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 17% relative F1 improvement while providing interpretable justifications for each decision.

### Antidistillation Fingerprinting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03812v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03812v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03812v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03812v1)

2026/02/03 18:15 GTM

Model distillation enables efficient emulation of frontier large language models (LLMs), creating a need for robust mechanisms to detect when a third-party student model has trained on a teacher model's outputs. However, existing fingerprinting techniques that could be used to detect such distillation rely on heuristic perturbations that impose a steep trade-off between generation quality and fingerprinting strength, often requiring significant degradation of utility to ensure the fingerprint is effectively internalized by the student. We introduce antidistillation fingerprinting (ADFP), a principled approach that aligns the fingerprinting objective with the student's learning dynamics. Building upon the gradient-based framework of antidistillation sampling, ADFP utilizes a proxy model to identify and sample tokens that directly maximize the expected detectability of the fingerprint in the student after fine-tuning, rather than relying on the incidental absorption of the un-targeted biases of a more naive watermark. Experiments on GSM8K and OASST1 benchmarks demonstrate that ADFP achieves a significant Pareto improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, yielding stronger detection confidence with minimal impact on utility, even when the student model's architecture is unknown.

Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

### FullStack-Agent: Enhancing Agentic Full-Stack Web Coding via Development-Oriented Testing and Repository Back-Translation

Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become a popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The code is released at https://github.com/mnluzimu/FullStack-Agent.

### WebSentinel: Detecting and Localizing Prompt Injection Attacks for Web Agents

Prompt injection attacks manipulate webpage content to cause web agents to execute attacker-specified tasks instead of the user's intended ones. Existing methods for detecting and localizing such attacks achieve limited effectiveness, as their underlying assumptions often do not hold in the web-agent setting. In this work, we propose WebSentinel, a two-step approach for detecting and localizing prompt injection attacks in webpages. Given a webpage, Step I extracts \emph{segments of interest} that may be contaminated, and Step II evaluates each segment by checking its consistency with the webpage content as context. We show that WebSentinel is highly effective, substantially outperforming baseline methods across multiple datasets of both contaminated and clean webpages that we collected. Our code is available at: https://github.com/wxl-lxw/WebSentinel.

### AOrchestra: Automating Sub-Agent Creation for Agentic Orchestration

Language agents have shown strong promise for task automation. Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient. Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench), AOrchestra achieves 16.28% relative improvement against the strongest baseline when paired with Gemini-3-Flash.

### Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission

Long-context inference with Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly due to quadratic attention and growing key-value caches, motivating context compression. In this work, we study soft context compression, where a long context is condensed into a small set of continuous representations. Existing methods typically re-purpose the LLM itself as a trainable compressor, relying on layer-by-layer self-attention to iteratively aggregate information. We argue that this paradigm suffers from two structural limitations: (i) progressive representation overwriting across layers (ii) uncoordinated allocation of compression capacity across tokens. We propose ComprExIT (Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission), a lightweight framework that formulates soft compression into a new paradigm: explicit information transmission over frozen LLM hidden states. This decouples compression from the model's internal self-attention dynamics. ComprExIT performs (i) depth-wise transmission to selectively transmit multi-layer information into token anchors, mitigating progressive overwriting, and (ii) width-wise transmission to aggregate anchors into a small number of slots via a globally optimized transmission plan, ensuring coordinated allocation of information. Across six question-answering benchmarks, ComprExIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art context compression methods while introducing only ~1% additional parameters, demonstrating that explicit and coordinated information transmission enables more effective and robust long-context compression.

### Efficient Estimation of Kernel Surrogate Models for Task Attribution

Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines. When used for downstream task selection, kernel surrogate models yield a $40\%$ improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Organizations handling sensitive documents face a tension: cloud-based AI risks GDPR violations, while local systems typically require 18-32 GB RAM. This paper presents CUBO, a systems-oriented RAG platform for consumer laptops with 16 GB shared memory. CUBO's novelty lies in engineering integration of streaming ingestion (O(1) buffer overhead), tiered hybrid retrieval, and hardware-aware orchestration that enables competitive Recall@10 (0.48-0.97 across BEIR domains) within a hard 15.5 GB RAM ceiling. The 37,000-line codebase achieves retrieval latencies of 185 ms (p50) on C1,300 laptops while maintaining data minimization through local-only processing aligned with GDPR Art. 5(1)(c). Evaluation on BEIR benchmarks validates practical deployability for small-to-medium professional archives. The codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/PaoloAstrino/CUBO.

### Training Multi-Turn Search Agent via Contrastive Dynamic Branch Sampling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03719v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03719v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03719v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03719v1)

Agentic reinforcement learning has enabled large language models to perform complex multi-turn planning and tool use. However, learning in long-horizon settings remains challenging due to sparse, trajectory-level outcome rewards. While prior tree-based methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often suffer from high variance and computational inefficiency. Through empirical analysis of search agents, We identify a common pattern: performance diverges mainly due to decisions near the tail. Motivated by this observation, we propose Branching Relative Policy Optimization (BranPO), a value-free method that provides step-level contrastive supervision without dense rewards. BranPO truncates trajectories near the tail and resamples alternative continuations to construct contrastive suffixes over shared prefixes, reducing credit ambiguity in long-horizon rollouts. To further boost efficiency and stabilize training, we introduce difficulty-aware branch sampling to adapt branching frequency across tasks, and redundant step masking to suppress uninformative actions. Extensive experiments on various question answering benchmarks demonstrate that BranPO consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significant accuracy gains on long-horizon tasks without increasing the overall training budget. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/YubaoZhao/BranPO}{code}.

### No Shortcuts to Culture: Indonesian Multi-hop Question Answering for Complex Cultural Understanding

Understanding culture requires reasoning across context, tradition, and implicit social knowledge, far beyond recalling isolated facts. Yet most culturally focused question answering (QA) benchmarks rely on single-hop questions, which may allow models to exploit shallow cues rather than demonstrate genuine cultural reasoning. In this work, we introduce ID-MoCQA, the first large-scale multi-hop QA dataset for assessing the cultural understanding of large language models (LLMs), grounded in Indonesian traditions and available in both English and Indonesian. We present a new framework that systematically transforms single-hop cultural questions into multi-hop reasoning chains spanning six clue types (e.g., commonsense, temporal, geographical). Our multi-stage validation pipeline, combining expert review and LLM-as-a-judge filtering, ensures high-quality question-answer pairs. Our evaluation across state-of-the-art models reveals substantial gaps in cultural reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring nuanced inference. ID-MoCQA provides a challenging and essential benchmark for advancing the cultural competency of LLMs.

### Beyond Tokens: Semantic-Aware Speculative Decoding for Efficient Inference by Probing Internal States
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03708v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03708v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03708v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03708v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many tasks but suffer from high inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. The issue is exacerbated in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which generate lengthy chains of thought. While speculative decoding accelerates inference by drafting and verifying multiple tokens in parallel, existing methods operate at the token level and ignore semantic equivalence (i.e., different token sequences expressing the same meaning), leading to inefficient rejections. We propose SemanticSpec, a semantic-aware speculative decoding framework that verifies entire semantic sequences instead of tokens. SemanticSpec introduces a semantic probability estimation mechanism that probes the model's internal hidden states to assess the likelihood of generating sequences with specific meanings.Experiments on four benchmarks show that SemanticSpec achieves up to 2.7x speedup on DeepSeekR1-32B and 2.1x on QwQ-32B, consistently outperforming token-level and sequence-level baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness.

### OmniRAG-Agent: Agentic Omnimodal Reasoning for Low-Resource Long Audio-Video Question Answering
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03707v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03707v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03707v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03707v1)

2026/02/03 16:28 GTM

Long-horizon omnimodal question answering answers questions by reasoning over text, images, audio, and video. Despite recent progress on OmniLLMs, low-resource long audio-video QA still suffers from costly dense encoding, weak fine-grained retrieval, limited proactive planning, and no clear end-to-end optimization.To address these issues, we propose OmniRAG-Agent, an agentic omnimodal QA method for budgeted long audio-video reasoning. It builds an image-audio retrieval-augmented generation module that lets an OmniLLM fetch short, relevant frames and audio snippets from external banks. Moreover, it uses an agent loop that plans, calls tools across turns, and merges retrieved evidence to answer complex queries. Furthermore, we apply group relative policy optimization to jointly improve tool use and answer quality over time. Experiments on OmniVideoBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni show that OmniRAG-Agent consistently outperforms prior methods under low-resource settings and achieves strong results, with ablations validating each component.

### Cognitively Diverse Multiple-Choice Question Generation: A Hybrid Multi-Agent Framework with Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03704v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03704v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03704v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03704v1)

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated multiple-choice question (MCQ) generation increasingly feasible; however, reliably producing items that satisfy controlled cognitive demands remains a challenge. To address this gap, we introduce ReQUESTA, a hybrid, multi-agent framework for generating cognitively diverse MCQs that systematically target text-based, inferential, and main idea comprehension. ReQUESTA decomposes MCQ authoring into specialized subtasks and coordinates LLM-powered agents with rule-based components to support planning, controlled generation, iterative evaluation, and post-processing. We evaluated the framework in a large-scale reading comprehension study using academic expository texts, comparing ReQUESTA-generated MCQs with those produced by a single-pass GPT-5 zero-shot baseline. Psychometric analyses of learner responses assessed item difficulty and discrimination, while expert raters evaluated question quality across multiple dimensions, including topic relevance and distractor quality. Results showed that ReQUESTA-generated items were consistently more challenging, more discriminative, and more strongly aligned with overall reading comprehension performance. Expert evaluations further indicated stronger alignment with central concepts and superior distractor linguistic consistency and semantic plausibility, particularly for inferential questions. These findings demonstrate that hybrid, agentic orchestration can systematically improve the reliability and controllability of LLM-based generation, highlighting workflow design as a key lever for structured artifact generation beyond single-pass prompting.

### Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Generalized Knowledge Editing with Multiple Updates

Large language models (LLMs) rely on internal knowledge to solve many downstream tasks, making it crucial to keep them up to date. Since full retraining is expensive, prior work has explored efficient alternatives such as model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, these approaches often break down in practice due to poor generalization across inputs, limited stability, and knowledge conflict. To address these limitations, we propose the CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) training framework, a parameter-efficient, holistic approach for knowledge editing with multiple updates. CoRSA tackles multiple challenges simultaneously: it improves generalization to different input forms and enhances stability across multiple updates by minimizing loss curvature, and resolves conflicts by maximizing the margin between new and prior knowledge. Across three widely used fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves significant gains in generalization, outperforming baselines with average absolute improvements of 12.42% over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods. With multiple updates, it maintains high update efficacy while reducing catastrophic forgetting by 27.82% compared to LoRA. CoRSA also generalizes to the code domain, outperforming the strongest baseline by 5.48% Pass@5 in update efficacy.

### Agent Primitives: Reusable Latent Building Blocks for Multi-Agent Systems

While existing multi-agent systems (MAS) can handle complex problems by enabling collaboration among multiple agents, they are often highly task-specific, relying on manually crafted agent roles and interaction prompts, which leads to increased architectural complexity and limited reusability across tasks. Moreover, most MAS communicate primarily through natural language, making them vulnerable to error accumulation and instability in long-context, multi-stage interactions within internal agent histories.
  In this work, we propose \textbf{Agent Primitives}, a set of reusable latent building blocks for LLM-based MAS. Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS.
  Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\times$-4$\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\times$-1.6$\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model backbones.

### OCRTurk: A Comprehensive OCR Benchmark for Turkish

Document parsing is now widely used in applications, such as large-scale document digitization, retrieval-augmented generation, and domain-specific pipelines in healthcare and education. Benchmarking these models is crucial for assessing their reliability and practical robustness. Existing benchmarks mostly target high-resource languages and provide limited coverage for low-resource settings, such as Turkish. Moreover, existing studies on Turkish document parsing lack a standardized benchmark that reflects real-world scenarios and document diversity. To address this gap, we introduce OCRTurk, a Turkish document parsing benchmark covering multiple layout elements and document categories at three difficulty levels. OCRTurk consists of 180 Turkish documents drawn from academic articles, theses, slide decks, and non-academic articles. We evaluate seven OCR models on OCRTurk using element-wise metrics. Across difficulty levels, PaddleOCR achieves the strongest overall results, leading most element-wise metrics except figures and attaining high Normalized Edit Distance scores in easy, medium, and hard subsets. We also observe performance variation by document type. Models perform well on non-academic documents, while slideshows become the most challenging.

### Rethinking the Reranker: Boundary-Aware Evidence Selection for Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain brittle under realistic retrieval noise, even when the required evidence appears in the top-K results. A key reason is that retrievers and rerankers optimize solely for relevance, often selecting either trivial, answer-revealing passages or evidence that lacks the critical information required to answer the question, without considering whether the evidence is suitable for the generator. We propose BAR-RAG, which reframes the reranker as a boundary-aware evidence selector that targets the generator's Goldilocks Zone -- evidence that is neither trivially easy nor fundamentally unanswerable for the generator, but is challenging yet sufficient for inference and thus provides the strongest learning signal. BAR-RAG trains the selector with reinforcement learning using generator feedback, and adopts a two-stage pipeline that fine-tunes the generator under the induced evidence distribution to mitigate the distribution mismatch between training and inference. Experiments on knowledge-intensive question answering benchmarks show that BAR-RAG consistently improves end-to-end performance under noisy retrieval, achieving an average gain of 10.3 percent over strong RAG and reranking baselines while substantially improving robustness. Code is publicly avaliable at https://github.com/GasolSun36/BAR-RAG.

### Neural Attention Search Linear: Towards Adaptive Token-Level Hybrid Attention Models

The quadratic computational complexity of softmax transformers has become a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. In contrast, linear attention model families provide a promising direction towards a more efficient sequential model. These linear attention models compress past KV values into a single hidden state, thereby efficiently reducing complexity during both training and inference. However, their expressivity remains limited by the size of their hidden state. Previous work proposed interleaving softmax and linear attention layers to reduce computational complexity while preserving expressivity. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these models remains bottlenecked by their softmax attention layers. In this paper, we propose Neural Attention Search Linear (NAtS-L), a framework that applies both linear attention and softmax attention operations within the same layer on different tokens. NAtS-L automatically determines whether a token can be handled by a linear attention model, i.e., tokens that have only short-term impact and can be encoded into fixed-size hidden states, or require softmax attention, i.e., tokens that contain information related to long-term retrieval and need to be preserved for future queries. By searching for optimal Gated DeltaNet and softmax attention combinations across tokens, we show that NAtS-L provides a strong yet efficient token-level hybrid architecture.

### Instruction Anchors: Dissecting the Causal Dynamics of Modality Arbitration

Modality following serves as the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to selectively utilize multimodal contexts based on user instructions. It is fundamental to ensuring safety and reliability in real-world deployments. However, the underlying mechanisms governing this decision-making process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate its working mechanism through an information flow lens. Our findings reveal that instruction tokens function as structural anchors for modality arbitration: Shallow attention layers perform non-selective information transfer, routing multimodal cues to these anchors as a latent buffer; Modality competition is resolved within deep attention layers guided by the instruction intent, while MLP layers exhibit semantic inertia, acting as an adversarial force. Furthermore, we identify a sparse set of specialized attention heads that drive this arbitration. Causal interventions demonstrate that manipulating a mere $5\%$ of these critical heads can decrease the modality-following ratio by $60\%$ through blocking, or increase it by $60\%$ through targeted amplification of failed samples. Our work provides a substantial step toward model transparency and offers a principled framework for the orchestration of multimodal information in MLLMs.

### RAGTurk: Best Practices for Retrieval Augmented Generation in Turkish

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM factuality, yet design guidance remains English-centric, limiting insights for morphologically rich languages like Turkish. We address this by constructing a comprehensive Turkish RAG dataset derived from Turkish Wikipedia and CulturaX, comprising question-answer pairs and relevant passage chunks. We benchmark seven stages of the RAG pipeline, from query transformation and reranking to answer refinement, without task-specific fine-tuning. Our results show that complex methods like HyDE maximize accuracy (85%) that is considerably higher than the baseline (78.70%). Also a Pareto-optimal configuration using Cross-encoder Reranking and Context Augmentation achieves comparable performance (84.60%) with much lower cost. We further demonstrate that over-stacking generative modules can degrade performance by distorting morphological cues, whereas simple query clarification with robust reranking offers an effective solution.

### Search-R2: Enhancing Search-Integrated Reasoning via Actor-Refiner Collaboration

Search-integrated reasoning enables language agents to transcend static parametric knowledge by actively querying external sources. However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.

Information retrieval has long focused on ranking documents by semantic relatedness. Yet many real-world information needs demand more: enforcement of logical constraints, multi-step inference, and synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. Addressing these requirements is, at its core, a problem of reasoning. Across AI communities, researchers are developing diverse solutions for the problem of reasoning, from inference-time strategies and post-training of LLMs, to neuro-symbolic systems, Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks, geometric representations, and energy-based models. These efforts target the same problem: to move beyond pattern-matching systems toward structured, verifiable inference. However, they remain scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for IR researchers to identify the most relevant ideas and opportunities. To help navigate the fragmented landscape of research in reasoning, this tutorial first articulates a working definition of reasoning within the context of information retrieval and derives from it a unified analytical framework. The framework maps existing approaches along axes that reflect the core components of the definition. By providing a comprehensive overview of recent approaches and mapping current methods onto the defined axes, we expose their trade-offs and complementarities, highlight where IR can benefit from cross-disciplinary advances, and illustrate how retrieval process itself can play a central role in broader reasoning systems. The tutorial will equip participants with both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for enhancing reasoning-capable IR systems, while situating IR as a domain that both benefits and contributes to the broader development of reasoning methodologies.

### TRE: Encouraging Exploration in the Trust Region

Entropy regularization is a standard technique in reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration, yet it yields negligible effects or even degrades performance in Large Language Models (LLMs). We attribute this failure to the cumulative tail risk inherent to LLMs with massive vocabularies and long generation horizons. In such environments, standard global entropy maximization indiscriminately dilutes probability mass into the vast tail of invalid tokens rather than focusing on plausible candidates, thereby disrupting coherent reasoning. To address this, we propose Trust Region Entropy (TRE), a method that encourages exploration strictly within the model's trust region. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning (MATH), combinatorial search (Countdown), and preference alignment (HH) tasks demonstrate that TRE consistently outperforms vanilla PPO, standard entropy regularization, and other exploration baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/WhyChaos/TRE-Encouraging-Exploration-in-the-Trust-Region.

### BIRDTurk: Adaptation of the BIRD Text-to-SQL Dataset to Turkish
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03633v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03633v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03633v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03633v1)

Text-to-SQL systems have achieved strong performance on English benchmarks, yet their behavior in morphologically rich, low-resource languages remains largely unexplored. We introduce BIRDTurk, the first Turkish adaptation of the BIRD benchmark, constructed through a controlled translation pipeline that adapts schema identifiers to Turkish while strictly preserving the logical structure and execution semantics of SQL queries and databases. Translation quality is validated on a sample size determined by the Central Limit Theorem to ensure 95% confidence, achieving 98.15% accuracy on human-evaluated samples. Using BIRDTurk, we evaluate inference-based prompting, agentic multi-stage reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. Our results reveal that Turkish introduces consistent performance degradation, driven by both structural linguistic divergence and underrepresentation in LLM pretraining, while agentic reasoning demonstrates stronger cross-lingual robustness. Supervised fine-tuning remains challenging for standard multilingual baselines but scales effectively with modern instruction-tuned models. BIRDTurk provides a controlled testbed for cross-lingual Text-to-SQL evaluation under realistic database conditions. We release the training and development splits to support future research.

### Learning Query-Specific Rubrics from Human Preferences for DeepResearch Report Generation

Nowadays, training and evaluating DeepResearch-generated reports remain challenging due to the lack of verifiable reward signals. Accordingly, rubric-based evaluation has become a common practice. However, existing approaches either rely on coarse, pre-defined rubrics that lack sufficient granularity, or depend on manually constructed query-specific rubrics that are costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce a Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies. Moreover, when integrated into the MaMs training framework, DeepResearch systems equipped with our rubric generators consistently outperform all open-source baselines on the DeepResearch Bench and achieve performance comparable to that of leading closed-source models.

### Controlling Output Rankings in Generative Engines for LLM-based Search

The way customers search for and choose products is changing with the rise of large language models (LLMs). LLM-based search, or generative engines, provides direct product recommendations to users, rather than traditional online search results that require users to explore options themselves. However, these recommendations are strongly influenced by the initial retrieval order of LLMs, which disadvantages small businesses and independent creators by limiting their visibility.
  In this work, we propose CORE, an optimization method that \textbf{C}ontrols \textbf{O}utput \textbf{R}ankings in g\textbf{E}nerative Engines for LLM-based search. Since the LLM's interactions with the search engine are black-box, CORE targets the content returned by search engines as the primary means of influencing output rankings. Specifically, CORE optimizes retrieved content by appending strategically designed optimization content to steer the ranking of outputs. We introduce three types of optimization content: string-based, reasoning-based, and review-based, demonstrating their effectiveness in shaping output rankings. To evaluate CORE in realistic settings, we introduce ProductBench, a large-scale benchmark with 15 product categories and 200 products per category, where each product is associated with its top-10 recommendations collected from Amazon's search interface.
  Extensive experiments on four LLMs with search capabilities (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, Claude-4, and Grok-3) demonstrate that CORE achieves an average Promotion Success Rate of \textbf{91.4\% @Top-5}, \textbf{86.6\% @Top-3}, and \textbf{80.3\% @Top-1}, across 15 product categories, outperforming existing ranking manipulation methods while preserving the fluency of optimized content.

### Efficient Algorithms for Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problems over Control-flow Graphs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03588v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03588v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03588v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03588v1)

In this work, we focus on the Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) over control-flow graphs (CFGs) of programs. PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \(O(|G| \cdot |D|^6)\), where \(|G|\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE. In addition, we provide experimental results over another classical PCSP task, i.e. Optimal Bank Selection, achieving runtimes four times better than the previous state of the art.

### CL-bench: A Benchmark for Context Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03587v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03587v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03587v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03587v1)

Current language models (LMs) excel at reasoning over prompts using pre-trained knowledge. However, real-world tasks are far more complex and context-dependent: models must learn from task-specific context and leverage new knowledge beyond what is learned during pre-training to reason and resolve tasks. We term this capability context learning, a crucial ability that humans naturally possess but has been largely overlooked. To this end, we introduce CL-bench, a real-world benchmark consisting of 500 complex contexts, 1,899 tasks, and 31,607 verification rubrics, all crafted by experienced domain experts. Each task is designed such that the new content required to resolve it is contained within the corresponding context. Resolving tasks in CL-bench requires models to learn from the context, ranging from new domain-specific knowledge, rule systems, and complex procedures to laws derived from empirical data, all of which are absent from pre-training. This goes far beyond long-context tasks that primarily test retrieval or reading comprehension, and in-context learning tasks, where models learn simple task patterns via instructions and demonstrations. Our evaluations of ten frontier LMs find that models solve only 17.2% of tasks on average. Even the best-performing model, GPT-5.1, solves only 23.7%, revealing that LMs have yet to achieve effective context learning, which poses a critical bottleneck for tackling real-world, complex context-dependent tasks. CL-bench represents a step towards building LMs with this fundamental capability, making them more intelligent and advancing their deployment in real-world scenarios.

### $V_0$: A Generalist Value Model for Any Policy at State Zero
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03584v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03584v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03584v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03584v1)

2026/02/03 14:35 GTM

Policy gradient methods rely on a baseline to measure the relative advantage of an action, ensuring the model reinforces behaviors that outperform its current average capability. In the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Actor-Critic methods (e.g., PPO), this baseline is typically estimated by a Value Model (Critic) often as large as the policy model itself. However, as the policy continuously evolves, the value model requires expensive, synchronous incremental training to accurately track the shifting capabilities of the policy. To avoid this overhead, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) eliminates the coupled value model by using the average reward of a group of rollouts as the baseline; yet, this approach necessitates extensive sampling to maintain estimation stability. In this paper, we propose $V_0$, a Generalist Value Model capable of estimating the expected performance of any model on unseen prompts without requiring parameter updates. We reframe value estimation by treating the policy's dynamic capability as an explicit context input; specifically, we leverage a history of instruction-performance pairs to dynamically profile the model, departing from the traditional paradigm that relies on parameter fitting to perceive capability shifts. Focusing on value estimation at State Zero (i.e., the initial prompt, hence $V_0$), our model serves as a critical resource scheduler. During GRPO training, $V_0$ predicts success rates prior to rollout, allowing for efficient sampling budget allocation; during deployment, it functions as a router, dispatching instructions to the most cost-effective and suitable model. Empirical results demonstrate that $V_0$ significantly outperforms heuristic budget allocation and achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between performance and cost in LLM routing tasks.

### Use Graph When It Needs: Efficiently and Adaptively Integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Graphs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03578v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03578v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03578v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03578v1)

2026/02/03 14:26 GTM

Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external corpora, its effectiveness is limited by fragmented information in unstructured domain documents. Graph-augmented RAG (GraphRAG) emerged to enhance contextual reasoning through structured knowledge graphs, yet paradoxically underperforms vanilla RAG in real-world scenarios, exhibiting significant accuracy drops and prohibitive latency despite gains on complex queries. We identify the rigid application of GraphRAG to all queries, regardless of complexity, as the root cause. To resolve this, we propose an efficient and adaptive GraphRAG framework called EA-GraphRAG that dynamically integrates RAG and GraphRAG paradigms through syntax-aware complexity analysis. Our approach introduces: (i) a syntactic feature constructor that parses each query and extracts a set of structural features; (ii) a lightweight complexity scorer that maps these features to a continuous complexity score; and (iii) a score-driven routing policy that selects dense RAG for low-score queries, invokes graph-based retrieval for high-score queries, and applies complexity-aware reciprocal rank fusion to handle borderline cases. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark, consisting of two single-hop and two multi-hop QA benchmarks, demonstrate that our EA-GraphRAG significantly improves accuracy, reduces latency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling mixed scenarios involving both simple and complex queries.

### ACL: Aligned Contrastive Learning Improves BERT and Multi-exit BERT Fine-tuning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03563v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03563v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03563v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03563v1)

2026/02/03 14:08 GTM

Despite its success in self-supervised learning, contrastive learning is less studied in the supervised setting. In this work, we first use a set of pilot experiments to show that in the supervised setting, the cross-entropy loss objective (CE) and the contrastive learning objective often conflict with each other, thus hindering the applications of CL in supervised settings. To resolve this problem, we introduce a novel \underline{A}ligned \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{L}earning (ACL) framework. First, ACL-Embed regards label embeddings as extra augmented samples with different labels and employs contrastive learning to align the label embeddings with its samples' representations. Second, to facilitate the optimization of ACL-Embed objective combined with the CE loss, we propose ACL-Grad, which will discard the ACL-Embed term if the two objectives are in conflict. To further enhance the performances of intermediate exits of multi-exit BERT, we further propose cross-layer ACL (ACL-CL), which is to ask the teacher exit to guide the optimization of student shallow exits. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark results in the following takeaways: (a) ACL-BRT outperforms or performs comparably with CE and CE+SCL on the GLUE tasks; (b) ACL, especially CL-ACL, significantly surpasses the baseline methods on the fine-tuning of multi-exit BERT, thus providing better quality-speed tradeoffs for low-latency applications.

### HySparse: A Hybrid Sparse Attention Architecture with Oracle Token Selection and KV Cache Sharing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03560v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03560v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03560v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03560v1)

2026/02/03 14:05 GTM

This work introduces Hybrid Sparse Attention (HySparse), a new architecture that interleaves each full attention layer with several sparse attention layers. While conceptually simple, HySparse strategically derives each sparse layer's token selection and KV caches directly from the preceding full attention layer. This architecture resolves two fundamental limitations of prior sparse attention methods. First, conventional approaches typically rely on additional proxies to predict token importance, introducing extra complexity and potentially suboptimal performance. In contrast, HySparse uses the full attention layer as a precise oracle to identify important tokens. Second, existing sparse attention designs often reduce computation without saving KV cache. HySparse enables sparse attention layers to reuse the full attention KV cache, thereby reducing both computation and memory. We evaluate HySparse on both 7B dense and 80B MoE models. Across all settings, HySparse consistently outperforms both full attention and hybrid SWA baselines. Notably, in the 80B MoE model with 49 total layers, only 5 layers employ full attention, yet HySparse achieves substantial performance gains while reducing KV cache storage by nearly 10x.

### When Single Answer Is Not Enough: Rethinking Single-Step Retrosynthesis Benchmarks for LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03554v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03554v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03554v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03554v1)

2026/02/03 14:03 GTM

Recent progress has expanded the use of large language models (LLMs) in drug discovery, including synthesis planning. However, objective evaluation of retrosynthesis performance remains limited. Existing benchmarks and metrics typically rely on published synthetic procedures and Top-K accuracy based on single ground-truth, which does not capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning. We propose a new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis that evaluates both general-purpose and chemistry-specialized LLMs using ChemCensor, a novel metric for chemical plausibility. By emphasizing plausibility over exact match, this approach better aligns with human synthesis planning practices. We also introduce CREED, a novel dataset comprising millions of ChemCensor-validated reaction records for LLM training, and use it to train a model that improves over the LLM baselines under this benchmark.

### Assessing the Impact of Typological Features on Multilingual Machine Translation in the Age of Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03551v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03551v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03551v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03551v1)

2026/02/03 14:02 GTM

Despite major advances in multilingual modeling, large quality disparities persist across languages. Besides the obvious impact of uneven training resources, typological properties have also been proposed to determine the intrinsic difficulty of modeling a language. The existing evidence, however, is mostly based on small monolingual language models or bilingual translation models trained from scratch. We expand on this line of work by analyzing two large pre-trained multilingual translation models, NLLB-200 and Tower+, which are state-of-the-art representatives of encoder-decoder and decoder-only machine translation, respectively. Based on a broad set of languages, we find that target language typology drives translation quality of both models, even after controlling for more trivial factors, such as data resourcedness and writing script. Additionally, languages with certain typological properties benefit more from a wider search of the output space, suggesting that such languages could profit from alternative decoding strategies beyond the standard left-to-right beam search. To facilitate further research in this area, we release a set of fine-grained typological properties for 212 languages of the FLORES+ MT evaluation benchmark.

### SEAD: Self-Evolving Agent for Multi-Turn Service Dialogue
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03548v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03548v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03548v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03548v1)

2026/02/03 14:01 GTM

Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-domain dialogues. However, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in service dialogues, as they rely on noisy, low-quality human conversation data. This limitation arises from data scarcity and the difficulty of simulating authentic, goal-oriented user behaviors. To address these issues, we propose SEAD (Self-Evolving Agent for Service Dialogue), a framework that enables agents to learn effective strategies without large-scale human annotations. SEAD decouples user modeling into two components: a Profile Controller that generates diverse user states to manage training curriculum, and a User Role-play Model that focuses on realistic role-playing. This design ensures the environment provides adaptive training scenarios rather than acting as an unfair adversary. Experiments demonstrate that SEAD significantly outperforms Open-source Foundation Models and Closed-source Commercial Models, improving task completion rate by 17.6% and dialogue efficiency by 11.1%. Code is available at: https://github.com/Da1yuqin/SEAD.

### Can Large Language Models Generalize Procedures Across Representations?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03542v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03542v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03542v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03542v1)

2026/02/03 13:56 GTM

Large language models (LLMs) are trained and tested extensively on symbolic representations such as code and graphs, yet real-world user tasks are often specified in natural language. To what extent can LLMs generalize across these representations? Here, we approach this question by studying isomorphic tasks involving procedures represented in code, graphs, and natural language (e.g., scheduling steps in planning). We find that training LLMs with popular post-training methods on graphs or code data alone does not reliably generalize to corresponding natural language tasks, while training solely on natural language can lead to inefficient performance gains. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage data curriculum that first trains on symbolic, then natural language data. The curriculum substantially improves model performance across model families and tasks. Remarkably, a 1.5B Qwen model trained by our method can closely match zero-shot GPT-4o in naturalistic planning. Finally, our analysis suggests that successful cross-representation generalization can be interpreted as a form of generative analogy, which our curriculum effectively encourages.

### Learning to Reason Faithfully through Step-Level Faithfulness Maximization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03507v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03507v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03507v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03507v1)

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has markedly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, most RLVR pipelines rely on sparse outcome-based rewards, providing little supervision over intermediate steps and thus encouraging over-confidence and spurious reasoning, which in turn increases hallucinations. To address this, we propose FaithRL, a general reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes reasoning faithfulness. We formalize a faithfulness-maximization objective and theoretically show that optimizing it mitigates over-confidence. To instantiate this objective, we introduce a geometric reward design and a faithfulness-aware advantage modulation mechanism that assigns step-level credit by penalizing unsupported steps while preserving valid partial derivations. Across diverse backbones and benchmarks, FaithRL consistently reduces hallucination rates while maintaining (and often improving) answer correctness. Further analysis confirms that FaithRL increases step-wise reasoning faithfulness and generalizes robustly. Our code is available at https://github.com/aintdoin/FaithRL.

### Decoupling Skeleton and Flesh: Efficient Multimodal Table Reasoning with Disentangled Alignment and Structure-aware Guidance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03491v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03491v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03491v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03491v1)

2026/02/03 13:08 GTM

Reasoning over table images remains challenging for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to complex layouts and tightly coupled structure-content information. Existing solutions often depend on expensive supervised training, reinforcement learning, or external tools, limiting efficiency and scalability. This work addresses a key question: how to adapt LVLMs to table reasoning with minimal annotation and no external tools? Specifically, we first introduce DiSCo, a Disentangled Structure-Content alignment framework that explicitly separates structural abstraction from semantic grounding during multimodal alignment, efficiently adapting LVLMs to tables structures. Building on DiSCo, we further present Table-GLS, a Global-to-Local Structure-guided reasoning framework that performs table reasoning via structured exploration and evidence-grounded inference. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework efficiently enhances LVLM's table understanding and reasoning capabilities, particularly generalizing to unseen table structures.

### Self-Verification Dilemma: Experience-Driven Suppression of Overused Checking in LLM Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03485v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03485v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03485v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03485v1)

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by generating long reasoning traces with reflection. Through a large-scale empirical analysis, we find that a substantial fraction of reflective steps consist of self-verification (recheck) that repeatedly confirm intermediate results. These rechecks occur frequently across models and benchmarks, yet the vast majority are confirmatory rather than corrective, rarely identifying errors and altering reasoning outcomes. This reveals a mismatch between how often self-verification is activated and how often it is actually useful. Motivated by this, we propose a novel, experience-driven test-time framework that reduces the overused verification. Our method detects the activation of recheck behavior, consults an offline experience pool of past verification outcomes, and estimates whether a recheck is likely unnecessary via efficient retrieval. When historical experience suggests unnecessary, a suppression signal redirects the model to proceed. Across multiple model and benchmarks, our approach reduces token usage up to 20.3% while maintaining the accuracy, and in some datasets even yields accuracy improvements.

### Preferences for Idiomatic Language are Acquired Slowly -- and Forgotten Quickly: A Case Study on Swedish
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03484v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03484v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03484v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03484v1)

2026/02/03 12:57 GTM

In this study, we investigate how language models develop preferences for \textit{idiomatic} as compared to \textit{linguistically acceptable} Swedish, both during pretraining and when adapting a model from English to Swedish. To do so, we train models on Swedish from scratch and by fine-tuning English-pretrained models, probing their preferences at various checkpoints using minimal pairs that differ in linguistic acceptability or idiomaticity. For linguistic acceptability, we adapt existing benchmarks into a minimal-pair format. To assess idiomaticity, we introduce two novel datasets: one contrasting conventionalized idioms with plausible variants, and another contrasting idiomatic Swedish with Translationese. Our findings suggest that idiomatic competence emerges more slowly than other linguistic abilities, including grammatical and lexical correctness. While longer training yields diminishing returns for most tasks, idiom-related performance continues to improve, particularly in the largest model tested (8B). However, instruction tuning on data machine-translated from English -- the common approach for languages with little or no native instruction data -- causes models to rapidly lose their preference for idiomatic language.

### A-RAG: Scaling Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Hierarchical Retrieval Interfaces
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03442v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03442v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03442v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03442v1)

Frontier language models have demonstrated strong reasoning and long-horizon tool-use capabilities. However, existing RAG systems fail to leverage these capabilities. They still rely on two paradigms: (1) designing an algorithm that retrieves passages in a single shot and concatenates them into the model's input, or (2) predefining a workflow and prompting the model to execute it step-by-step. Neither paradigm allows the model to participate in retrieval decisions, preventing efficient scaling with model improvements. In this paper, we introduce A-RAG, an Agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model. A-RAG provides three retrieval tools: keyword search, semantic search, and chunk read, enabling the agent to adaptively search and retrieve information across multiple granularities. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks show that A-RAG consistently outperforms existing approaches with comparable or lower retrieved tokens, demonstrating that A-RAG effectively leverages model capabilities and dynamically adapts to different RAG tasks. We further systematically study how A-RAG scales with model size and test-time compute. We will release our code and evaluation suite to facilitate future research. Code and evaluation suite are available at https://github.com/Ayanami0730/arag.

### DiscoverLLM: From Executing Intents to Discovering Them

To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking "what kind of tone do you want?" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.

### SWE-World: Building Software Engineering Agents in Docker-Free Environments

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled software engineering agents to tackle complex code modification tasks. Most existing approaches rely on execution feedback from containerized environments, which require dependency-complete setup and physical execution of programs and tests. While effective, this paradigm is resource-intensive and difficult to maintain, substantially complicating agent training and limiting scalability. We propose SWE-World, a Docker-free framework that replaces physical execution environments with a learned surrogate for training and evaluating software engineering agents. SWE-World leverages LLM-based models trained on real agent-environment interaction data to predict intermediate execution outcomes and final test feedback, enabling agents to learn without interacting with physical containerized environments. This design preserves the standard agent-environment interaction loop while eliminating the need for costly environment construction and maintenance during agent optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, because SWE-World can simulate the final evaluation outcomes of candidate trajectories without real submission, it enables selecting the best solution among multiple test-time attempts, thereby facilitating effective test-time scaling (TTS) in software engineering tasks. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that SWE-World raises Qwen2.5-Coder-32B from 6.2\% to 52.0\% via Docker-free SFT, 55.0\% with Docker-free RL, and 68.2\% with further TTS.

### FactNet: A Billion-Scale Knowledge Graph for Multilingual Factual Grounding

While LLMs exhibit remarkable fluency, their utility is often compromised by factual hallucinations and a lack of traceable provenance. Existing resources for grounding mitigate this but typically enforce a dichotomy: they offer either structured knowledge without textual context (e.g., knowledge bases) or grounded text with limited scale and linguistic coverage. To bridge this gap, we introduce FactNet, a massive, open-source resource designed to unify 1.7 billion atomic assertions with 3.01 billion auditable evidence pointers derived exclusively from 316 Wikipedia editions. Unlike recent synthetic approaches, FactNet employs a strictly deterministic construction pipeline, ensuring that every evidence unit is recoverable with byte-level precision. Extensive auditing confirms a high grounding precision of 92.1%, even in long-tail languages. Furthermore, we establish FactNet-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite for Knowledge Graph Completion, Question Answering, and Fact Checking. FactNet provides the community with a foundational, reproducible resource for training and evaluating trustworthy, verifiable multilingual systems.

### Verified Critical Step Optimization for LLM Agents

As large language model agents tackle increasingly complex long-horizon tasks, effective post-training becomes critical. Prior work faces fundamental challenges: outcome-only rewards fail to precisely attribute credit to intermediate steps, estimated step-level rewards introduce systematic noise, and Monte Carlo sampling approaches for step reward estimation incur prohibitive computational cost. Inspired by findings that only a small fraction of high-entropy tokens drive effective RL for reasoning, we propose Critical Step Optimization (CSO), which focuses preference learning on verified critical steps, decision points where alternate actions demonstrably flip task outcomes from failure to success. Crucially, our method starts from failed policy trajectories rather than expert demonstrations, directly targeting the policy model's weaknesses. We use a process reward model (PRM) to identify candidate critical steps, leverage expert models to propose high-quality alternatives, then continue execution from these alternatives using the policy model itself until task completion. Only alternatives that the policy successfully executes to correct outcomes are verified and used as DPO training data, ensuring both quality and policy reachability. This yields fine-grained, verifiable supervision at critical decisions while avoiding trajectory-level coarseness and step-level noise. Experiments on GAIA-Text-103 and XBench-DeepSearch show that CSO achieves 37% and 26% relative improvement over the SFT baseline and substantially outperforms other post-training methods, while requiring supervision at only 16% of trajectory steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of selective verification-based learning for agent post-training.

### SWE-Master: Unleashing the Potential of Software Engineering Agents via Post-Training

In this technical report, we present SWE-Master, an open-source and fully reproducible post-training framework for building effective software engineering agents. SWE-Master systematically explores the complete agent development pipeline, including teacher-trajectory synthesis and data curation, long-horizon SFT, RL with real execution feedback, and inference framework design. Starting from an open-source base model with limited initial SWE capability, SWE-Master demonstrates how systematical optimization method can elicit strong long-horizon SWE task solving abilities. We evaluate SWE-Master on SWE-bench Verified, a standard benchmark for realistic software engineering tasks. Under identical experimental settings, our approach achieves a resolve rate of 61.4\% with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines. By further incorporating test-time scaling~(TTS) with LLM-based environment feedback, SWE-Master reaches 70.8\% at TTS@8, demonstrating a strong performance potential. SWE-Master provides a practical and transparent foundation for advancing reproducible research on software engineering agents. The code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/SWE-Master.

### Towards Distillation-Resistant Large Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Perspective

Proprietary large language models (LLMs) embody substantial economic value and are generally exposed only as black-box APIs, yet adversaries can still exploit their outputs to extract knowledge via distillation. Existing defenses focus exclusively on text-based distillation, leaving the important logit-based distillation largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze this problem and present an effective solution from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize distillation-relevant information in teacher outputs using the conditional mutual information (CMI) between teacher logits and input queries conditioned on ground-truth labels. This quantity captures contextual information beneficial for model extraction, motivating us to defend distillation via CMI minimization. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we propose learning a transformation matrix that purifies the original outputs to enhance distillation resistance. We further derive a CMI-inspired anti-distillation objective to optimize this transformation, which effectively removes distillation-relevant information while preserving output utility. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and strong distillation algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method significantly degrades distillation performance while preserving task accuracy, effectively protecting models' intellectual property.

### Pursuing Best Industrial Practices for Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the Medical Domain

While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been swiftly adopted in industrial applications based on large language models (LLMs), there is no consensus on what are the best practices for building a RAG system in terms of what are the components, how to organize these components and how to implement each component for the industrial applications, especially in the medical domain. In this work, we first carefully analyze each component of the RAG system and propose practical alternatives for each component. Then, we conduct systematic evaluations on three types of tasks, revealing the best practices for improving the RAG system and how LLM-based RAG systems make trade-offs between performance and efficiency.

### MeKi: Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection for Efficient LLM Scaling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03359v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03359v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03359v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03359v1)

Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) typically relies on increasing the number of parameters or test-time computations to boost performance. However, these strategies are impractical for edge device deployment due to limited RAM and NPU resources. Despite hardware constraints, deploying performant LLM on edge devices such as smartphone remains crucial for user experience. To address this, we propose MeKi (Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection), a novel system that scales LLM capacity via storage space rather than FLOPs. MeKi equips each Transformer layer with token-level memory experts that injects pre-stored semantic knowledge into the generation process. To bridge the gap between training capacity and inference efficiency, we employ a re-parameterization strategy to fold parameter matrices used during training into a compact static lookup table. By offloading the knowledge to ROM, MeKi decouples model capacity from computational cost, introducing zero inference latency overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, validating the effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs. Project homepage is at https://github.com/ningding-o/MeKi.

### GFlowPO: Generative Flow Network as a Language Model Prompt Optimizer
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03358v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03358v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03358v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03358v1)

Finding effective prompts for language models (LMs) is critical yet notoriously difficult: the prompt space is combinatorially large, rewards are sparse due to expensive target-LM evaluation. Yet, existing RL-based prompt optimizers often rely on on-policy updates and a meta-prompt sampled from a fixed distribution, leading to poor sample efficiency. We propose GFlowPO, a probabilistic prompt optimization framework that casts prompt search as a posterior inference problem over latent prompts regularized by a meta-prompted reference-LM prior. In the first step, we fine-tune a lightweight prompt-LM with an off-policy Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objective, using a replay-based training policy that reuses past prompt evaluations to enable sample-efficient exploration. In the second step, we introduce Dynamic Memory Update (DMU), a training-free mechanism that updates the meta-prompt by injecting both (i) diverse prompts from a replay buffer and (ii) top-performing prompts from a small priority queue, thereby progressively concentrating the search process on high-reward regions. Across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks, GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines.

### PEGRL: Improving Machine Translation by Post-Editing Guided Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03352v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03352v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03352v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03352v1)

2026/02/03 10:22 GTM

Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong promise for LLM-based machine translation, with recent methods such as GRPO demonstrating notable gains; nevertheless, translation-oriented RL remains challenged by noisy learning signals arising from Monte Carlo return estimation, as well as a large trajectory space that favors global exploration over fine-grained local optimization. We introduce \textbf{PEGRL}, a \textit{two-stage} RL framework that uses post-editing as an auxiliary task to stabilize training and guide overall optimization. At each iteration, translation outputs are sampled to construct post-editing inputs, allowing return estimation in the post-editing stage to benefit from conditioning on the current translation behavior, while jointly supporting both global exploration and fine-grained local optimization. A task-specific weighting scheme further balances the contributions of translation and post-editing objectives, yielding a biased yet more sample-efficient estimator. Experiments on English$\to$Finnish, English$\to$Turkish, and English$\leftrightarrow$Chinese show consistent gains over RL baselines, and for English$\to$Turkish, performance on COMET-KIWI is comparable to advanced LLM-based systems (DeepSeek-V3.2).

### Robustness as an Emergent Property of Task Performance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03344v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03344v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03344v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03344v1)

Robustness is often regarded as a critical future challenge for real-world applications, where stability is essential. However, as models often learn tasks in a similar order, we hypothesize that easier tasks will be easier regardless of how they are presented to the model. Indeed, in this paper, we show that as models approach high performance on a task, robustness is effectively achieved. Through an empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (e.g., paraphrases, different temperatures), we find a strong positive correlation. Moreover, we find that robustness is primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties, challenging current approaches that treat robustness as an independent capability. Thus, from a high-level perspective, we may expect that as new tasks saturate, model robustness on these tasks will emerge accordingly. For researchers, this implies that explicit efforts to measure and improve robustness may warrant reduced emphasis, as such robustness is likely to develop alongside performance gains. For practitioners, it acts as a sign that indeed the tasks that the literature deals with are unreliable, but on easier past tasks, the models are reliable and ready for real-world deployment.

### Accurate Failure Prediction in Agents Does Not Imply Effective Failure Prevention
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03338v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03338v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03338v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03338v1)

Proactive interventions by LLM critic models are often assumed to improve reliability, yet their effects at deployment time are poorly understood. We show that a binary LLM critic with strong offline accuracy (AUROC 0.94) can nevertheless cause severe performance degradation, inducing a 26 percentage point (pp) collapse on one model while affecting another by near zero pp. This variability demonstrates that LLM critic accuracy alone is insufficient to determine whether intervention is safe.
  We identify a disruption-recovery tradeoff: interventions may recover failing trajectories but also disrupt trajectories that would have succeeded. Based on this insight, we propose a pre-deployment test that uses a small pilot of 50 tasks to estimate whether intervention is likely to help or harm, without requiring full deployment. Across benchmarks, the test correctly anticipates outcomes: intervention degrades performance on high-success tasks (0 to -26 pp), while yielding a modest improvement on the high-failure ALFWorld benchmark (+2.8 pp, p=0.014). The primary value of our framework is therefore identifying when not to intervene, preventing severe regressions before deployment.

### MIRROR: A Multi-Agent Framework with Iterative Adaptive Revision and Hierarchical Retrieval for Optimization Modeling in Operations Research
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03318v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03318v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03318v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03318v1)

Operations Research (OR) relies on expert-driven modeling-a slow and fragile process ill-suited to novel scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) can automatically translate natural language into optimization models, existing approaches either rely on costly post-training or employ multi-agent frameworks, yet most still lack reliable collaborative error correction and task-specific retrieval, often leading to incorrect outputs. We propose MIRROR, a fine-tuning-free, end-to-end multi-agent framework that directly translates natural language optimization problems into mathematical models and solver code. MIRROR integrates two core mechanisms: (1) execution-driven iterative adaptive revision for automatic error correction, and (2) hierarchical retrieval to fetch relevant modeling and coding exemplars from a carefully curated exemplar library. Experiments show that MIRROR outperforms existing methods on standard OR benchmarks, with notable results on complex industrial datasets such as IndustryOR and Mamo-ComplexLP. By combining precise external knowledge infusion with systematic error correction, MIRROR provides non-expert users with an efficient and reliable OR modeling solution, overcoming the fundamental limitations of general-purpose LLMs in expert optimization tasks.

### R1-SyntheticVL: Is Synthetic Data from Generative Models Ready for Multimodal Large Language Model?

In this work, we aim to develop effective data synthesis techniques that autonomously synthesize multimodal training data for enhancing MLLMs in solving complex real-world tasks. To this end, we propose Collective Adversarial Data Synthesis (CADS), a novel and general approach to synthesize high-quality, diverse and challenging multimodal data for MLLMs. The core idea of CADS is to leverage collective intelligence to ensure high-quality and diverse generation, while exploring adversarial learning to synthesize challenging samples for effectively driving model improvement. Specifically, CADS operates with two cyclic phases, i.e., Collective Adversarial Data Generation (CAD-Generate) and Collective Adversarial Data Judgment (CAD-Judge). CAD-Generate leverages collective knowledge to jointly generate new and diverse multimodal data, while CAD-Judge collaboratively assesses the quality of synthesized data. In addition, CADS introduces an Adversarial Context Optimization mechanism to optimize the generation context to encourage challenging and high-value data generation. With CADS, we construct MMSynthetic-20K and train our model R1-SyntheticVL, which demonstrates superior performance on various benchmarks.

### POP: Prefill-Only Pruning for Efficient Large Model Inference

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, their deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. Existing structured pruning methods, while hardware-efficient, often suffer from significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we argue that this failure stems from a stage-agnostic pruning approach that overlooks the asymmetric roles between the prefill and decode stages. By introducing a virtual gate mechanism, our importance analysis reveals that deep layers are critical for next-token prediction (decode) but largely redundant for context encoding (prefill). Leveraging this insight, we propose Prefill-Only Pruning (POP), a stage-aware inference strategy that safely omits deep layers during the computationally intensive prefill stage while retaining the full model for the sensitive decode stage. To enable the transition between stages, we introduce independent Key-Value (KV) projections to maintain cache integrity, and a boundary handling strategy to ensure the accuracy of the first generated token. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1, Qwen3-VL, and Gemma-3 across diverse modalities demonstrate that POP achieves up to 1.37$\times$ speedup in prefill latency with minimal performance loss, effectively overcoming the accuracy-efficiency trade-off limitations of existing structured pruning methods.

### Mići Princ -- A Little Boy Teaching Speech Technologies the Chakavian Dialect

This paper documents our efforts in releasing the printed and audio book of the translation of the famous novel The Little Prince into the Chakavian dialect, as a computer-readable, AI-ready dataset, with the textual and the audio components of the two releases now aligned on the level of each written and spoken word. Our motivation for working on this release is multiple. The first one is our wish to preserve the highly valuable and specific content beyond the small editions of the printed and the audio book. With the dataset published in the CLARIN.SI repository, this content is from now on at the fingertips of any interested individual. The second motivation is to make the data available for various artificial-intelligence-related usage scenarios, such as the one we follow upon inside this paper already -- adapting the Whisper-large-v3 open automatic speech recognition model, with decent performance on standard Croatian, to Chakavian dialectal speech. We can happily report that with adapting the model, the word error rate on the selected test data has being reduced to a half, while we managed to remove up to two thirds of the error on character level. We envision many more usages of this dataset beyond the set of experiments we have already performed, both on tasks of artificial intelligence research and application, as well as dialectal research. The third motivation for this release is our hope that this, now highly structured dataset, will be transformed into a digital online edition of this work, allowing individuals beyond the research and technology communities to enjoy the beauty of the message of the little boy in the desert, told through the spectacular prism of the Chakavian dialect.

### Merging Beyond: Streaming LLM Updates via Activation-Guided Rotations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03237v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03237v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03237v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03237v1)

The escalating scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient adaptation techniques. Model merging has gained prominence for its efficiency and controllability. However, existing merging techniques typically serve as post-hoc refinements or focus on mitigating task interference, often failing to capture the dynamic optimization benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose Streaming Merging, an innovative model updating paradigm that conceptualizes merging as an iterative optimization process. Central to this paradigm is \textbf{ARM} (\textbf{A}ctivation-guided \textbf{R}otation-aware \textbf{M}erging), a strategy designed to approximate gradient descent dynamics. By treating merging coefficients as learning rates and deriving rotation vectors from activation subspaces, ARM effectively steers parameter updates along data-driven trajectories. Unlike conventional linear interpolation, ARM aligns semantic subspaces to preserve the geometric structure of high-dimensional parameter evolution. Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (e.g., math, code) demonstrate that ARM can transcend converged checkpoints. Extensive experiments show that ARM provides a scalable and lightweight framework for efficient model adaptation.

### ATACompressor: Adaptive Task-Aware Compression for Efficient Long-Context Processing in LLMs

Long-context inputs in large language models (LLMs) often suffer from the "lost in the middle" problem, where critical information becomes diluted or ignored due to excessive length. Context compression methods aim to address this by reducing input size, but existing approaches struggle with balancing information preservation and compression efficiency. We propose Adaptive Task-Aware Compressor (ATACompressor), which dynamically adjusts compression based on the specific requirements of the task. ATACompressor employs a selective encoder that compresses only the task-relevant portions of long contexts, ensuring that essential information is preserved while reducing unnecessary content. Its adaptive allocation controller perceives the length of relevant content and adjusts the compression rate accordingly, optimizing resource utilization. We evaluate ATACompressor on three QA datasets: HotpotQA, MSMARCO, and SQUAD-showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both compression efficiency and task performance. Our approach provides a scalable solution for long-context processing in LLMs. Furthermore, we perform a range of ablation studies and analysis experiments to gain deeper insights into the key components of ATACompressor.

### Token Sparse Attention: Efficient Long-Context Inference with Interleaved Token Selection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03216v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03216v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03216v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03216v1)

The quadratic complexity of attention remains the central bottleneck in long-context inference for large language models. Prior acceleration methods either sparsify the attention map with structured patterns or permanently evict tokens at specific layers, which can retain irrelevant tokens or rely on irreversible early decisions despite the layer-/head-wise dynamics of token importance. In this paper, we propose Token Sparse Attention, a lightweight and dynamic token-level sparsification mechanism that compresses per-head $Q$, $K$, $V$ to a reduced token set during attention and then decompresses the output back to the original sequence, enabling token information to be reconsidered in subsequent layers. Furthermore, Token Sparse Attention exposes a new design point at the intersection of token selection and sparse attention. Our approach is fully compatible with dense attention implementations, including Flash Attention, and can be seamlessly composed with existing sparse attention kernels. Experimental results show that Token Sparse Attention consistently improves accuracy-latency trade-off, achieving up to $\times$3.23 attention speedup at 128K context with less than 1% accuracy degradation. These results demonstrate that dynamic and interleaved token-level sparsification is a complementary and effective strategy for scalable long-context inference.

### ForesightKV: Optimizing KV Cache Eviction for Reasoning Models by Learning Long-Term Contribution
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03203v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03203v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03203v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03203v1)

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning abilities by producing long reasoning traces. However, as the sequence length grows, the key-value (KV) cache expands linearly, incurring significant memory and computation costs. Existing KV cache eviction methods mitigate this issue by discarding less important KV pairs, but often fail to capture complex KV dependencies, resulting in performance degradation. To better balance efficiency and performance, we introduce ForesightKV, a training-based KV cache eviction framework that learns to predict which KV pairs to evict during long-text generations. We first design the Golden Eviction algorithm, which identifies the optimal eviction KV pairs at each step using future attention scores. These traces and the scores at each step are then distilled via supervised training with a Pairwise Ranking Loss. Furthermore, we formulate cache eviction as a Markov Decision Process and apply the GRPO algorithm to mitigate the significant language modeling loss increase on low-entropy tokens. Experiments on AIME2024 and AIME2025 benchmarks of three reasoning models demonstrate that ForesightKV consistently outperforms prior methods under only half the cache budget, while benefiting synergistically from both supervised and reinforcement learning approaches.

### Prompt Augmentation Scales up GRPO Training on Mathematical Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03190v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03190v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03190v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03190v1)

Reinforcement learning algorithms such as group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated strong potential for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, prior work has consistently observed an entropy collapse phenomenon during reinforcement post-training, characterized by a monotonic decrease in policy entropy that ultimately leads to training instability and collapse. As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 44.5 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/wenquanlu/prompt-augmentation-GRPO.

Although Key-Value (KV) Cache is essential for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference, its growing memory footprint in long-context scenarios poses a significant bottleneck, making KVCache compression crucial. Current compression methods rely on rigid splitting strategies, such as fixed intervals or pre-defined delimiters. We observe that rigid splitting suffers from significant accuracy degradation (ranging from 5.5% to 55.1%) across different scenarios, owing to the scenario-dependent nature of the semantic boundaries. This highlights the necessity of dynamic semantic splitting to match semantics. To achieve this, we face two challenges. (1) Improper delimiter selection misaligns semantics with the KVCache, resulting in 28.6% accuracy loss. (2) Variable-length blocks after splitting introduce over 73.1% additional inference overhead. To address the above challenges, we propose DynSplit-KV, a KVCache compression method that dynamically identifies delimiters for splitting. We propose: (1) a dynamic importance-aware delimiter selection strategy, improving accuracy by 49.9%. (2) A uniform mapping strategy that transforms variable-length semantic blocks into a fixed-length format, reducing inference overhead by 4.9x. Experiments show that DynSplit-KV achieves the highest accuracy, 2.2x speedup compared with FlashAttention and 2.6x peak memory reduction in long-context scenarios.

Research involving privacy-sensitive data has always been constrained by data scarcity, standing in sharp contrast to other areas that have benefited from data scaling. This challenge is becoming increasingly urgent as modern AI agents--such as OpenClaw and Gemini Agent--are granted persistent access to highly sensitive personal information. To tackle this longstanding bottleneck and the rising risks, we present Privasis (i.e., privacy oasis), the first million-scale fully synthetic dataset entirely built from scratch--an expansive reservoir of texts with rich and diverse private information--designed to broaden and accelerate research in areas where processing sensitive social data is inevitable. Compared to existing datasets, Privasis, comprising 1.4 million records, offers orders-of-magnitude larger scale with quality, and far greater diversity across various document types, including medical history, legal documents, financial records, calendars, and text messages with a total of 55.1 million annotated attributes such as ethnicity, date of birth, workplace, etc. We leverage Privasis to construct a parallel corpus for text sanitization with our pipeline that decomposes texts and applies targeted sanitization. Our compact sanitization models (<=4B) trained on this dataset outperform state-of-the-art large language models, such as GPT-5 and Qwen-3 235B. We plan to release data, models, and code to accelerate future research on privacy-sensitive domains and agents.

### VALUEFLOW: Toward Pluralistic and Steerable Value-based Alignment in Large Language Models

Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with the diverse spectrum of human values remains a central challenge: preference-based methods often fail to capture deeper motivational principles. Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. This paper establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity, advancing pluralistic alignment of LLMs.

### FASA: Frequency-aware Sparse Attention

The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical bottleneck when handling lengthy inputs: the prohibitive memory footprint of the Key Value (KV) cache. To address this bottleneck, the token pruning paradigm leverages attention sparsity to selectively retain a small, critical subset of tokens. However, existing approaches fall short, with static methods risking irreversible information loss and dynamic strategies employing heuristics that insufficiently capture the query-dependent nature of token importance. We propose FASA, a novel framework that achieves query-aware token eviction by dynamically predicting token importance. FASA stems from a novel insight into RoPE: the discovery of functional sparsity at the frequency-chunk (FC) level. Our key finding is that a small, identifiable subset of "dominant" FCs consistently exhibits high contextual agreement with the full attention head. This provides a robust and computationally free proxy for identifying salient tokens. %making them a powerful and efficient proxy for token importance. Building on this insight, FASA first identifies a critical set of tokens using dominant FCs, and then performs focused attention computation solely on this pruned subset. % Since accessing only a small fraction of the KV cache, FASA drastically lowers memory bandwidth requirements and computational cost. Across a spectrum of long-context tasks, from sequence modeling to complex CoT reasoning, FASA consistently outperforms all token-eviction baselines and achieves near-oracle accuracy, demonstrating remarkable robustness even under constraint budgets. Notably, on LongBench-V1, FASA reaches nearly 100\% of full-KV performance when only keeping 256 tokens, and achieves 2.56$\times$ speedup using just 18.9\% of the cache on AIME24.

### Self-Hinting Language Models Enhance Reinforcement Learning

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has recently emerged as a practical recipe for aligning large language models with verifiable objectives. However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $τ$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,τ)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct. The code is available at https://github.com/BaohaoLiao/SAGE.

### Short Chains, Deep Thoughts: Balancing Reasoning Efficiency and Intra-Segment Capability via Split-Merge Optimization

While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks through the generation of long reasoning chains, this reliance on verbose generation results in significant latency and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{CoSMo} (\textbf{Co}nsistency-Guided \textbf{S}plit-\textbf{M}erge \textbf{O}ptimization), a framework designed to eliminate structural redundancy rather than indiscriminately restricting token volume. Specifically, CoSMo utilizes a split-merge algorithm that dynamically refines reasoning chains by merging redundant segments and splitting logical gaps to ensure coherence. We then employ structure-aligned reinforcement learning with a novel segment-level budget to supervise the model in maintaining efficient reasoning structures throughout training. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoSMo achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by \textbf{3.3} points while reducing segment usage by \textbf{28.7\%} on average compared to reasoning efficiency baselines.

### Conformal Reachability for Safe Control in Unknown Environments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03799v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03799v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03799v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03799v1)

Designing provably safe control is a core problem in trustworthy autonomy. However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward.

### BridgeV2W: Bridging Video Generation Models to Embodied World Models via Embodiment Masks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03793v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03793v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03793v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03793v1)

2026/02/03 17:56 GTM

Embodied world models have emerged as a promising paradigm in robotics, most of which leverage large-scale Internet videos or pretrained video generation models to enrich visual and motion priors. However, they still face key challenges: a misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoint, and non-unified architectures across embodiments. To this end, we present BridgeV2W, which converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks rendered from the URDF and camera parameters. These masks are then injected into a pretrained video generation model via a ControlNet-style pathway, which aligns the action control signals with predicted videos, adds view-specific conditioning to accommodate camera viewpoints, and yields a unified world model architecture across embodiments. To mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds, BridgeV2W further introduces a flow-based motion loss that focuses on learning dynamic and task-relevant regions. Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets, covering diverse and challenging conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, show that BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the potential of BridgeV2W on downstream real-world tasks, including policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning. More results can be found on our project website at https://BridgeV2W.github.io .

### QVLA: Not All Channels Are Equal in Vision-Language-Action Model's Quantization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03782v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03782v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03782v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03782v1)

The advent of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represents a significant leap for embodied intelligence, yet their immense computational demands critically hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware. Code will be released.

### A Scene Graph Backed Approach to Open Set Semantic Mapping
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03781v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03781v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03781v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03781v1)

While Open Set Semantic Mapping and 3D Semantic Scene Graphs (3DSSGs) are established paradigms in robotic perception, deploying them effectively to support high-level reasoning in large-scale, real-world environments remains a significant challenge. Most existing approaches decouple perception from representation, treating the scene graph as a derivative layer generated post hoc. This limits both consistency and scalability. In contrast, we propose a mapping architecture where the 3DSSG serves as the foundational backend, acting as the primary knowledge representation for the entire mapping process.
  Our approach leverages prior work on incremental scene graph prediction to infer and update the graph structure in real-time as the environment is explored. This ensures that the map remains topologically consistent and computationally efficient, even during extended operations in large-scale settings. By maintaining an explicit, spatially grounded representation that supports both flat and hierarchical topologies, we bridge the gap between sub-symbolic raw sensor data and high-level symbolic reasoning. Consequently, this provides a stable, verifiable structure that knowledge-driven frameworks, ranging from knowledge graphs and ontologies to Large Language Models (LLMs), can directly exploit, enabling agents to operate with enhanced interpretability, trustworthiness, and alignment to human concepts.

### Input-to-State Safe Backstepping: Robust Safety-Critical Control with Unmatched Uncertainties

Guaranteeing safety in the presence of unmatched disturbances -- uncertainties that cannot be directly canceled by the control input -- remains a key challenge in nonlinear control. This paper presents a constructive approach to safety-critical control of nonlinear systems with unmatched disturbances. We first present a generalization of the input-to-state safety (ISSf) framework for systems with these uncertainties using the recently developed notion of an Optimal Decay CBF, which provides more flexibility for satisfying the associated Lyapunov-like conditions for safety. From there, we outline a procedure for constructing ISSf-CBFs for two relevant classes of systems with unmatched uncertainties: i) strict-feedback systems; ii) dual-relative-degree systems, which are similar to differentially flat systems. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations of an inverted pendulum and planar quadrotor.

### When Should Agents Coordinate in Differentiable Sequential Decision Problems?

Multi-robot teams must coordinate to operate effectively. When a team operates in an uncoordinated manner, and agents choose actions that are only individually optimal, the team's outcome can suffer. However, in many domains, coordination requires costly communication. We explore the value of coordination in a broad class of differentiable motion-planning problems. In particular, we model coordinated behavior as a spectrum: at one extreme, agents jointly optimize a common team objective, and at the other, agents make unilaterally optimal decisions given their individual decision variables, i.e., they operate at Nash equilibria. We then demonstrate that reasoning about coordination in differentiable motion-planning problems reduces to reasoning about the second-order properties of agents' objectives, and we provide algorithms that use this second-order reasoning to determine at which times a team of agents should coordinate.

### MVP-LAM: Learning Action-Centric Latent Action via Cross-Viewpoint Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03668v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03668v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03668v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03668v1)

Learning \emph{latent actions} from diverse human videos enables scaling robot learning beyond embodiment-specific robot datasets, and these latent actions have recently been used as pseudo-action labels for vision-language-action (VLA) model pretraining. To make VLA pretraining effective, latent actions should contain information about the underlying agent's actions despite the absence of ground-truth labels. We propose \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew\textbf{P}oint \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}ction \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MVP-LAM}), which learns discrete latent actions that are highly informative about ground-truth actions from time-synchronized multi-view videos. MVP-LAM trains latent actions with a \emph{cross-viewpoint reconstruction} objective, so that a latent action inferred from one view must explain the future in another view, reducing reliance on viewpoint-specific cues. On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions, achieving higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on the SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks.

### Variance-Reduced Model Predictive Path Integral via Quadratic Model Approximation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03639v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03639v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03639v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03639v1)

2026/02/03 15:23 GTM

Sampling-based controllers, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) methods, offer substantial flexibility but often suffer from high variance and low sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework that integrates a prior model into the sampling process. Our key insight is to decompose the objective function into a known approximate model and a residual term. Since the residual captures only the discrepancy between the model and the objective, it typically exhibits a smaller magnitude and lower variance than the original objective. Although this principle applies to general modeling choices, we demonstrate that adopting a quadratic approximation enables the derivation of a closed-form, model-guided prior that effectively concentrates samples in informative regions. Crucially, the framework is agnostic to the source of geometric information, allowing the quadratic model to be constructed from exact derivatives, structural approximations (e.g., Gauss- or Quasi-Newton), or gradient-free randomized smoothing. We validate the approach on standard optimization benchmarks, a nonlinear, underactuated cart-pole control task, and a contact-rich manipulation problem with non-smooth dynamics. Across these domains, we achieve faster convergence and superior performance in low-sample regimes compared to standard MPPI. These results suggest that the method can make sample-based control strategies more practical in scenarios where obtaining samples is expensive or limited.

### Self-supervised Physics-Informed Manipulation of Deformable Linear Objects with Non-negligible Dynamics
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03623v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03623v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03623v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03623v1)

2026/02/03 15:14 GTM

We address dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects by presenting SPiD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that couples an accurate deformable object model with an augmented self-supervised training strategy. On the modeling side, we extend a mass-spring model to more accurately capture object dynamics while remaining lightweight enough for high-throughput rollouts during self-supervised learning. On the learning side, we train a neural controller using a task-oriented cost, enabling end-to-end optimization through interaction with the differentiable object model. In addition, we propose a self-supervised DAgger variant that detects distribution shift during deployment and performs offline self-correction to further enhance robustness without expert supervision. We evaluate our method primarily on the rope stabilization task, where a robot must bring a swinging rope to rest as quickly and smoothly as possible. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves fast and smooth rope stabilization, generalizing across unseen initial states, rope lengths, masses, non-uniform mass distributions, and external disturbances. Additionally, we develop an affordable markerless rope perception method and demonstrate that our controller maintains performance with noisy and low-frequency state updates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the framework by extending it to the rope trajectory tracking task. Overall, SPiD offers a data-efficient, robust, and physically grounded framework for dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects, featuring strong sim-to-real generalization.

### Human-in-the-Loop Failure Recovery with Adaptive Task Allocation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03603v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03603v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03603v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03603v1)

Since the recent Covid-19 pandemic, mobile manipulators and humanoid assistive robots with higher levels of autonomy have increasingly been adopted for patient care and living assistance. Despite advancements in autonomy, these robots often struggle to perform reliably in dynamic and unstructured environments and require human intervention to recover from failures. Effective human-robot collaboration is essential to enable robots to receive assistance from the most competent operator, in order to reduce their workload and minimize disruptions in task execution. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for allocating robotic failures to human operators (ARFA). Our proposed approach models the capabilities of human operators, and continuously updates these beliefs based on their actual performance for failure recovery. For every failure to be resolved, a reward function calculates expected outcomes based on operator capabilities and historical data, task urgency, and current workload distribution. The failure is then assigned to the operator with the highest expected reward. Our simulations and user studies show that ARFA outperforms random allocation, significantly reducing robot idle time, improving overall system performance, and leading to a more distributed workload among operators.

### Multi-Player, Multi-Strategy Quantum Game Model for Interaction-Aware Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03571v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03571v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03571v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03571v1)

2026/02/03 14:14 GTM

Although significant progress has been made in decision-making for automated driving, challenges remain for deployment in the real world. One challenge lies in addressing interaction-awareness. Most existing approaches oversimplify interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents, and often neglect interactions among the agents themselves. A common solution is to model these interactions using classical game theory. However, its formulation assumes rational players, whereas human behavior is frequently uncertain or irrational. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model, a novel framework that combines classical game theory with quantum mechanics principles (such as superposition, entanglement, and interference) to tackle multi-player, multi-strategy decision-making problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to apply quantum game theory to decision-making for automated driving. QGDM runs in real time on a standard computer, without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate QGDM in simulation across various scenarios, including roundabouts, merging, and highways, and compare its performance with multiple baseline methods. Results show that QGDM significantly improves success rates and reduces collision rates compared to classical approaches, particularly in scenarios with high interaction.

### Formal Evidence Generation for Assurance Cases for Robotic Software Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03550v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03550v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03550v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03550v1)

Robotics and Autonomous Systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, so that demonstrating their safety is essential. Assurance Cases (ACs) provide structured arguments supported by evidence, but generating and maintaining this evidence is labour-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to keep consistent as systems evolve. We present a model-based approach to systematically generating AC evidence by embedding formal verification into the assurance workflow. The approach addresses three challenges: systematically deriving formal assertions from natural language requirements using templates, orchestrating multiple formal verification tools to handle diverse property types, and integrating formal evidence production into the workflow. Leveraging RoboChart, a domain-specific modelling language with formal semantics, we combine model checking and theorem proving in our approach. Structured requirements are automatically transformed into formal assertions using predefined templates, and verification results are automatically integrated as evidence. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### AffordanceGrasp-R1:Leveraging Reasoning-Based Affordance Segmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Grasping

2026/02/03 14:00 GTM

We introduce AffordanceGrasp-R1, a reasoning-driven affordance segmentation framework for robotic grasping that combines a chain-of-thought (CoT) cold-start strategy with reinforcement learning to enhance deduction and spatial grounding. In addition, we redesign the grasping pipeline to be more context-aware by generating grasp candidates from the global scene point cloud and subsequently filtering them using instruction-conditioned affordance masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordanceGrasp-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on benchmark datasets, and real-world robotic grasping evaluations further validate its robustness and generalization under complex language-conditioned manipulation scenarios.

### Investigating the Influence of Spatial Ability in Augmented Reality-assisted Robot Programming
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03544v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03544v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03544v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03544v1)

Augmented Reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to enhance learning, but its mechanisms and effects are not yet fully understood. As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles.

### CMR: Contractive Mapping Embeddings for Robust Humanoid Locomotion on Unstructured Terrains

Robust disturbance rejection remains a longstanding challenge in humanoid locomotion, particularly on unstructured terrains where sensing is unreliable and model mismatch is pronounced. While perception information, such as height map, enhances terrain awareness, sensor noise and sim-to-real gaps can destabilize policies in practice. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis that bounds the return gap under observation noise, when the induced latent dynamics are contractive. Furthermore, we present Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework that maps high-dimensional, disturbance-prone observations into a latent space, where local perturbations are attenuated over time. Specifically, this approach couples contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while explicitly controlling sensitivity. Notably, the formulation can be incorporated into modern deep reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary loss term with minimal additional technical effort required. Further, our extensive humanoid experiments show that CMR potently outperforms other locomotion algorithms under increased noise.

### HetroD: A High-Fidelity Drone Dataset and Benchmark for Autonomous Driving in Heterogeneous Traffic
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03447v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03447v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03447v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03447v1)

We present HetroD, a dataset and benchmark for developing autonomous driving systems in heterogeneous environments. HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

### CRL-VLA: Continual Vision-Language-Action Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03445v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03445v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03445v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03445v1)

Lifelong learning is critical for embodied agents in open-world environments, where reinforcement learning fine-tuning has emerged as an important paradigm to enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to master dexterous manipulation through environmental interaction. Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes these conflicting objectives, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting and forward adaptation.

### Model-based Optimal Control for Rigid-Soft Underactuated Systems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03435v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03435v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03435v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03435v1)

Continuum soft robots are inherently underactuated and subject to intrinsic input constraints, making dynamic control particularly challenging, especially in hybrid rigid-soft robots. While most existing methods focus on quasi-static behaviors, dynamic tasks such as swing-up require accurate exploitation of continuum dynamics. This has led to studies on simple low-order template systems that often fail to capture the complexity of real continuum deformations. Model-based optimal control offers a systematic solution; however, its application to rigid-soft robots is often limited by the computational cost and inaccuracy of numerical differentiation for high-dimensional models. Building on recent advances in the Geometric Variable Strain model that enable analytical derivatives, this work investigates three optimal control strategies for underactuated soft systems-Direct Collocation, Differential Dynamic Programming, and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-to perform dynamic swing-up tasks. To address stiff continuum dynamics and constrained actuation, implicit integration schemes and warm-start strategies are employed to improve numerical robustness and computational efficiency. The methods are evaluated in simulation on three Rigid-Soft and high-order soft benchmark systems-the Soft Cart-Pole, the Soft Pendubot, and the Soft Furuta Pendulum- highlighting their performance and computational trade-offs.

### ProAct: A Benchmark and Multimodal Framework for Structure-Aware Proactive Response

While passive agents merely follow instructions, proactive agents align with higher-level objectives, such as assistance and safety by continuously monitoring the environment to determine when and how to act. However, developing proactive agents is hindered by the lack of specialized resources. To address this, we introduce ProAct-75, a benchmark designed to train and evaluate proactive agents across diverse domains, including assistance, maintenance, and safety monitoring. Spanning 75 tasks, our dataset features 91,581 step-level annotations enriched with explicit task graphs. These graphs encode step dependencies and parallel execution possibilities, providing the structural grounding necessary for complex decision-making. Building on this benchmark, we propose ProAct-Helper, a reference baseline powered by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that grounds decision-making in state detection, and leveraging task graphs to enable entropy-driven heuristic search for action selection, allowing agents to execute parallel threads independently rather than mirroring the human's next step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProAct-Helper outperforms strong closed-source models, improving trigger detection mF1 by 6.21%, saving 0.25 more steps in online one-step decision, and increasing the rate of parallel actions by 15.58%.

### Learning-based Initialization of Trajectory Optimization for Path-following Problems of Redundant Manipulators
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03418v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03418v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03418v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03418v1)

Trajectory optimization (TO) is an efficient tool to generate a redundant manipulator's joint trajectory following a 6-dimensional Cartesian path. The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines. We also show the performance improvement and feasibility via real-world experiments with a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.

### Deep-Learning-Based Control of a Decoupled Two-Segment Continuum Robot for Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03406v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03406v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03406v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03406v1)

2026/02/03 11:35 GTM

Manual endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is technically demanding, and existing single-segment robotic tools offer limited dexterity. These limitations motivate the development of more advanced solutions. To address this, DESectBot, a novel dual segment continuum robot with a decoupled structure and integrated surgical forceps, enabling 6 degrees of freedom (DoFs) tip dexterity for improved lesion targeting in ESD, was developed in this work. Deep learning controllers based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) for simultaneous tip position and orientation control, effectively handling the nonlinear coupling between continuum segments, were proposed. The GRU controller was benchmarked against Jacobian based inverse kinematics, model predictive control (MPC), a feedforward neural network (FNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In nested-rectangle and Lissajous trajectory tracking tasks, the GRU achieved the lowest position/orientation RMSEs: 1.11 mm/ 4.62° and 0.81 mm/ 2.59°, respectively. For orientation control at a fixed position (four target poses), the GRU attained a mean RMSE of 0.14 mm and 0.72°, outperforming all alternatives. In a peg transfer task, the GRU achieved a 100% success rate (120 success/120 attempts) with an average transfer time of 11.8s, the STD significantly outperforms novice-controlled systems. Additionally, an ex vivo ESD demonstration grasping, elevating, and resecting tissue as the scalpel completed the cut confirmed that DESectBot provides sufficient stiffness to divide thick gastric mucosa and an operative workspace adequate for large lesions.These results confirm that GRU-based control significantly enhances precision, reliability, and usability in ESD surgical training scenarios.

### Enhancing Navigation Efficiency of Quadruped Robots via Leveraging Personal Transportation Platforms
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03397v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03397v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03397v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03397v1)

2026/02/03 11:17 GTM

Quadruped robots face limitations in long-range navigation efficiency due to their reliance on legs. To ameliorate the limitations, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning-based Active Transporter Riding method (\textit{RL-ATR}), inspired by humans' utilization of personal transporters, including Segways. The \textit{RL-ATR} features a transporter riding policy and two state estimators. The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the \textit{RL-ATR}. This riding ability could broaden the locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding the operational range and efficiency.

### PlanTRansformer: Unified Prediction and Planning with Goal-conditioned Transformer
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03376v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03376v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03376v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03376v1)

Trajectory prediction and planning are fundamental yet disconnected components in autonomous driving. Prediction models forecast surrounding agent motion under unknown intentions, producing multimodal distributions, while planning assumes known ego objectives and generates deterministic trajectories. This mismatch creates a critical bottleneck: prediction lacks supervision for agent intentions, while planning requires this information. Existing prediction models, despite strong benchmarking performance, often remain disconnected from planning constraints such as collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. We introduce Plan TRansformer (PTR), a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. A teacher-student training strategy progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable. PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to the baseline Motion Transformer (MTR) and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer. The architecture-agnostic design enables application to diverse Transformer-based prediction models. Project Website: https://github.com/SelzerConst/PlanTRansformer

### Learning-based Adaptive Control of Quadruped Robots for Active Stabilization on Moving Platforms

A quadruped robot faces balancing challenges on a six-degrees-of-freedom moving platform, like subways, buses, airplanes, and yachts, due to independent platform motions and resultant diverse inertia forces on the robot. To alleviate these challenges, we present the Learning-based Active Stabilization on Moving Platforms (\textit{LAS-MP}), featuring a self-balancing policy and system state estimators. The policy adaptively adjusts the robot's posture in response to the platform's motion. The estimators infer robot and platform states based on proprioceptive sensor data. For a systematic training scheme across various platform motions, we introduce platform trajectory generation and scheduling methods. Our evaluation demonstrates superior balancing performance across multiple metrics compared to three baselines. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the \textit{LAS-MP}, including ablation studies and evaluation of the estimators, to validate the effectiveness of each component.

### Manipulation via Force Distribution at Contact
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03350v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03350v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03350v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03350v1)

Efficient and robust trajectories play a crucial role in contact-rich manipulation, which demands accurate mod- eling of object-robot interactions. Many existing approaches rely on point contact models due to their computational effi- ciency. Simple contact models are computationally efficient but inherently limited for achieving human-like, contact-rich ma- nipulation, as they fail to capture key frictional dynamics and torque generation observed in human manipulation. This study introduces a Force-Distributed Line Contact (FDLC) model in contact-rich manipulation and compares it against conventional point contact models. A bi-level optimization framework is constructed, in which the lower-level solves an optimization problem for contact force computation, and the upper-level optimization applies iLQR for trajectory optimization. Through this framework, the limitations of point contact are demon- strated, and the benefits of the FDLC in generating efficient and robust trajectories are established. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by a box rotating task, demonstrating that FDLC enables trajectories generated via non-uniform force distributions along the contact line, while requiring lower control effort and less motion of the robot.

### RDT2: Exploring the Scaling Limit of UMI Data Towards Zero-Shot Cross-Embodiment Generalization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03310v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03310v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03310v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03310v1)

2026/02/03 09:38 GTM

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold promise for generalist robotics but currently struggle with data scarcity, architectural inefficiencies, and the inability to generalize across different hardware platforms. We introduce RDT2, a robotic foundation model built upon a 7B parameter VLM designed to enable zero-shot deployment on novel embodiments for open-vocabulary tasks. To achieve this, we collected one of the largest open-source robotic datasets--over 10,000 hours of demonstrations in diverse families--using an enhanced, embodiment-agnostic Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI). Our approach employs a novel three-stage training recipe that aligns discrete linguistic knowledge with continuous control via Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), flow-matching, and distillation for real-time inference. Consequently, RDT2 becomes one of the first models that simultaneously zero-shot generalizes to unseen objects, scenes, instructions, and even robotic platforms. Besides, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in dexterous, long-horizon, and dynamic downstream tasks like playing table tennis. See https://rdt-robotics.github.io/rdt2/ for more information.

### LEVIO: Lightweight Embedded Visual Inertial Odometry for Resource-Constrained Devices
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03294v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03294v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03294v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03294v1)

Accurate, infrastructure-less sensor systems for motion tracking are essential for mobile robotics and augmented reality (AR) applications. The most popular state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems, however, are too computationally demanding for resource-constrained hardware, such as micro-drones and smart glasses. This work presents LEVIO, a fully featured VIO pipeline optimized for ultra-low-power compute platforms, allowing six-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) real-time sensing. LEVIO incorporates established VIO components such as Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature tracking and bundle adjustment, while emphasizing a computationally efficient architecture with parallelization and low memory usage to suit embedded microcontrollers and low-power systems-on-chip (SoCs). The paper proposes and details the algorithmic design choices and the hardware-software co-optimization approach, and presents real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware. LEVIO is validated on a parallel-processing ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, achieving 20 FPS while consuming less than 100 mW, and benchmarked against public VIO datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility and adoption, the complete implementation is released as open-source.

### Collision Detection with Analytical Derivatives of Contact Kinematics
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03250v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03250v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03250v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03250v1)

2026/02/03 08:34 GTM

Differentiable contact kinematics are essential for gradient-based methods in robotics, yet the mapping from robot state to contact distance, location, and normal becomes non-smooth in degenerate configurations of shapes with zero or undefined curvature. We address this inherent limitation by selectively regularizing such geometries into strictly convex implicit representations, restoring uniqueness and smoothness of the contact map. Leveraging this geometric regularization, we develop iDCOL, an implicit differentiable collision detection and contact kinematics framework. iDCOL represents colliding bodies using strictly convex implicit surfaces and computes collision detection and contact kinematics by solving a fixed-size nonlinear system derived from a geometric scaling-based convex optimization formulation. By applying the Implicit Function Theorem to the resulting system residual, we derive analytical derivatives of the contact kinematic quantities. We develop a fast Newton-based solver for iDCOL and provide an open-source C++ implementation of the framework. The robustness of the approach is evaluated through extensive collision simulations and benchmarking, and applicability is demonstrated in gradient-based kinematic path planning and differentiable contact physics, including multi-body rigid collisions and a soft-robot interaction example.

### A thin and soft optical tactile sensor for highly sensitive object perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03248v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03248v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03248v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03248v1)

2026/02/03 08:28 GTM

Tactile sensing is crucial in robotics and wearable devices for safe perception and interaction with the environment. Optical tactile sensors have emerged as promising solutions, as they are immune to electromagnetic interference and have high spatial resolution. However, existing optical approaches, particularly vision-based tactile sensors, rely on complex optical assemblies that involve lenses and cameras, resulting in bulky, rigid, and alignment-sensitive designs. In this study, we present a thin, compact, and soft optical tactile sensor featuring an alignment-free configuration. The soft optical sensor operates by capturing deformation-induced changes in speckle patterns generated within a soft silicone material, thereby enabling precise force measurements and texture recognition via machine learning. The experimental results show a root-mean-square error of 40 mN in the force measurement and a classification accuracy of 93.33% over nine classes of textured surfaces, including Mahjong tiles. The proposed speckle-based approach provides a compact, easily fabricated, and mechanically compliant platform that bridges optical sensing with flexible shape-adaptive architectures, thereby demonstrating its potential as a novel tactile-sensing paradigm for soft robotics and wearable haptic interfaces.

### Omnidirectional Solid-State mmWave Radar Perception for UAV Power Line Collision Avoidance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03229v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03229v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03229v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03229v1)

2026/02/03 08:02 GTM

Detecting and estimating distances to power lines is a challenge for both human UAV pilots and autonomous systems, which increases the risk of unintended collisions. We present a mmWave radar-based perception system that provides spherical sensing coverage around a small UAV for robust power line detection and avoidance. The system integrates multiple compact solid-state mmWave radar modules to synthesize an omnidirectional field of view while remaining lightweight. We characterize the sensing behavior of this omnidirectional radar arrangement in power line environments and develop a robust detection-and-avoidance algorithm tailored to that behavior. Field experiments on real power lines demonstrate reliable detection at ranges up to 10 m, successful avoidance maneuvers at flight speeds upwards of 10 m/s, and detection of wires as thin as 1.2 mm in diameter. These results indicate the approach's suitability as an additional safety layer for both autonomous and manual UAV flight.

### Depth Completion in Unseen Field Robotics Environments Using Extremely Sparse Depth Measurements
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03209v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03209v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03209v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03209v1)

2026/02/03 07:24 GTM

Autonomous field robots operating in unstructured environments require robust perception to ensure safe and reliable operations. Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have demonstrated the potential of low-cost cameras as depth sensors; however, their adoption in field robotics remains limited due to the absence of reliable scale cues, ambiguous or low-texture conditions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a depth completion model that trains on synthetic data and uses extremely sparse measurements from depth sensors to predict dense metric depth in unseen field robotics environments. A synthetic dataset generation pipeline tailored to field robotics enables the creation of multiple realistic datasets for training purposes. This dataset generation approach utilizes textured 3D meshes from Structure from Motion and photorealistic rendering with novel viewpoint synthesis to simulate diverse field robotics scenarios. Our approach achieves an end-to-end latency of 53 ms per frame on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin, enabling real-time deployment on embedded platforms. Extensive evaluation demonstrates competitive performance across diverse real-world field robotics scenarios.

### HUSKY: Humanoid Skateboarding System via Physics-Aware Whole-Body Control

While current humanoid whole-body control frameworks predominantly rely on the static environment assumptions, addressing tasks characterized by high dynamism and complex interactions presents a formidable challenge. In this paper, we address humanoid skateboarding, a highly challenging task requiring stable dynamic maneuvering on an underactuated wheeled platform. This integrated system is governed by non-holonomic constraints and tightly coupled human-object interactions. Successfully executing this task requires simultaneous mastery of hybrid contact dynamics and robust balance control on a mechanically coupled, dynamically unstable skateboard. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose HUSKY, a learning-based framework that integrates humanoid-skateboard system modeling and physics-aware whole-body control. We first model the coupling relationship between board tilt and truck steering angles, enabling a principled analysis of system dynamics. Building upon this, HUSKY leverages Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to learn human-like pushing motions and employs a physics-guided, heading-oriented strategy for lean-to-steer behaviors. Moreover, a trajectory-guided mechanism ensures smooth and stable transitions between pushing and steering. Experimental results on the Unitree G1 humanoid platform demonstrate that our framework enables stable and agile maneuvering on skateboards in real-world scenarios.

### Hierarchical Proportion Models for Motion Generation via Integration of Motion Primitives

Imitation learning (IL) enables robots to acquire human-like motion skills from demonstrations, but it still requires extensive high-quality data and retraining to handle complex or long-horizon tasks. To improve data efficiency and adaptability, this study proposes a hierarchical IL framework that integrates motion primitives with proportion-based motion synthesis. The proposed method employs a two-layer architecture, where the upper layer performs long-term planning, while a set of lower-layer models learn individual motion primitives, which are combined according to specific proportions. Three model variants are introduced to explore different trade-offs between learning flexibility, computational cost, and adaptability: a learning-based proportion model, a sampling-based proportion model, and a playback-based proportion model, which differ in how the proportions are determined and whether the upper layer is trainable. Through real-robot pick-and-place experiments, the proposed models successfully generated complex motions not included in the primitive set. The sampling-based and playback-based proportion models achieved more stable and adaptable motion generation than the standard hierarchical model, demonstrating the effectiveness of proportion-based motion integration for practical robot learning.

### Estimation of Ground Reaction Forces from Kinematic Data during Locomotion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03177v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03177v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03177v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03177v1)

Ground reaction forces (GRFs) provide fundamental insight into human gait mechanics and are widely used to assess joint loading, limb symmetry, balance control, and motor function. Despite their clinical relevance, the use of GRF remains underutilised in clinical workflows due to the practical limitations of force plate systems. In this work, we present a force-plate-free approach for estimating GRFs using only marker-based motion capture data. This kinematics only method to estimate and decompose GRF makes it well suited for widespread clinical depolyment. By using kinematics from sixteen body segments, we estimate the centre of mass (CoM) and compute GRFs, which are subsequently decomposed into individual components through a minimization-based approach. Through this framework, we can identify gait stance phases and provide access to clinically meaningful kinetic measures without a dedicated force plate system. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of CoM and GRF estimation based solely on kinematic data, supporting force-plate-free gait analysis.

### When Attention Betrays: Erasing Backdoor Attacks in Robotic Policies by Reconstructing Visual Tokens
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03153v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03153v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03153v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03153v1)

Downstream fine-tuning of vision-language-action (VLA) models enhances robotics, yet exposes the pipeline to backdoor risks. Attackers can pretrain VLAs on poisoned data to implant backdoors that remain stealthy but can trigger harmful behavior during inference. However, existing defenses either lack mechanistic insight into multimodal backdoors or impose prohibitive computational costs via full-model retraining. To this end, we uncover a deep-layer attention grabbing mechanism: backdoors redirect late-stage attention and form compact embedding clusters near the clean manifold. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Bera, a test-time backdoor erasure framework that detects tokens with anomalous attention via latent-space localization, masks suspicious regions using deep-layer cues, and reconstructs a trigger-free image to break the trigger-unsafe-action mapping while restoring correct behavior. Unlike prior defenses, Bera requires neither retraining of VLAs nor any changes to the training pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple embodied platforms and tasks show that Bera effectively maintains nominal performance, significantly reduces attack success rates, and consistently restores benign behavior from backdoored outputs, thereby offering a robust and practical defense mechanism for securing robotic systems.

### Multi-function Robotized Surgical Dissector for Endoscopic Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy: Preclinical Study and Evaluation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03147v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.03147v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03147v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.03147v1)

Patients suffering chronic severe pulmonary thromboembolism need Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy (PTE) to remove the thromb and intima located inside pulmonary artery (PA). During the surgery, a surgeon holds tweezers and a dissector to delicately strip the blockage, but available tools for this surgery are rigid and straight, lacking distal dexterity to access into thin branches of PA. Therefore, this work presents a novel robotized dissector based on concentric push/pull robot (CPPR) structure, enabling entering deep thin branch of tortuous PA. Compared with conventional rigid dissectors, our design characterizes slenderness and dual-segment-bending dexterity. Owing to the hollow and thin-walled structure of the CPPR-based dissector as it has a slender body of 3.5mm in diameter, the central lumen accommodates two channels for irrigation and tip tool, and space for endoscopic camera's signal wire. To provide accurate surgical manipulation, optimization-based kinematics model was established, realizing a 2mm accuracy in positioning the tip tool (60mm length) under open-loop control strategy. As such, with the endoscopic camera, traditional PTE is possible to be upgraded as endoscopic PTE. Basic physic performance of the robotized dissector including stiffness, motion accuracy and maneuverability was evaluated through experiments. Surgery simulation on ex vivo porcine lung also demonstrates its dexterity and notable advantages in PTE.
