### SAGE: Scalable Agentic 3D Scene Generation for Embodied AI
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10116v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10116v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10116v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10116v1)

Real-world data collection for embodied agents remains costly and unsafe, calling for scalable, realistic, and simulator-ready 3D environments. However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., "pick up a bowl and place it on the table"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI. Code, demos, and the SAGE-10k dataset can be found on the project page here: https://nvlabs.github.io/sage.

### Quantum Multiple Rotation Averaging
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10115v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10115v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10115v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10115v1)

Multiple rotation averaging (MRA) is a fundamental optimization problem in 3D vision and robotics that aims to recover globally consistent absolute rotations from noisy relative measurements. Established classical methods, such as L1-IRLS and Shonan, face limitations including local minima susceptibility and reliance on convex relaxations that fail to preserve the exact manifold geometry, leading to reduced accuracy in high-noise scenarios. We introduce IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization), the first algorithm that reformulates MRA as a sequence of local quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers after binarization, to leverage inherent hardware advantages. IQARS removes convex relaxation dependence and better preserves non-Euclidean rotation manifold geometry while leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient solution space exploration. We evaluate IQARS's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. While current annealers remain in their nascent phase and only support solving problems of limited scale with constrained performance, we observed that IQARS on D-Wave annealers can already achieve ca. 12% higher accuracy than Shonan, i.e., the best-performing classical method evaluated empirically.

### ConsID-Gen: View-Consistent and Identity-Preserving Image-to-Video Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10113v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10113v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10113v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10113v1)

Image-to-Video generation (I2V) animates a static image into a temporally coherent video sequence following textual instructions, yet preserving fine-grained object identity under changing viewpoints remains a persistent challenge. Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios. We will release our model and dataset at https://myangwu.github.io/ConsID-Gen.

### Olaf-World: Orienting Latent Actions for Video World Modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10104v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10104v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10104v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10104v1)

2026/02/10 18:58 GTM

Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.

### VideoWorld 2: Learning Transferable Knowledge from Real-world Videos
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10102v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10102v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10102v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10102v1)

Learning transferable knowledge from unlabeled video data and applying it in new environments is a fundamental capability of intelligent agents. This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN. This study reveals the potential of learning transferable world knowledge directly from raw videos, with all code, data, and models to be open-sourced for further research.

### Learning on the Manifold: Unlocking Standard Diffusion Transformers with Representation Encoders
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10099v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10099v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10099v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10099v1)

Leveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers a path for efficient, high-fidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge. Code: https://github.com/amandpkr/RJF

### VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10098v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10098v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10098v1)

2026/02/10 18:58 GTM

Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is \emph{leakage-free state prediction}: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.

### Causality in Video Diffusers is Separable from Denoising
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10095v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10095v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10095v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10095v1)

2026/02/10 18:57 GTM

Causality -- referring to temporal, uni-directional cause-effect relationships between components -- underlies many complex generative processes, including videos, language, and robot trajectories. Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.

### 4RC: 4D Reconstruction via Conditional Querying Anytime and Anywhere
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10094v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10094v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10094v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10094v1)

2026/02/10 18:57 GTM

We present 4RC, a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks.

### Can Image Splicing and Copy-Move Forgery Be Detected by the Same Model? Forensim: An Attention-Based State-Space Approach
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10079v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10079v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10079v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10079v1)

2026/02/10 18:46 GTM

We introduce Forensim, an attention-based state-space framework for image forgery detection that jointly localizes both manipulated (target) and source regions. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on artifact cues to detect spliced or forged areas, Forensim is designed to capture duplication patterns crucial for understanding context. In scenarios such as protest imagery, detecting only the forged region, for example a duplicated act of violence inserted into a peaceful crowd, can mislead interpretation, highlighting the need for joint source-target localization. Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture. We propose a visual state-space model that leverages normalized attention maps to identify internal similarities, paired with a region-based block attention module to distinguish manipulated regions. This design enables end-to-end training and precise localization. Forensim achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. We also release CMFD-Anything, a new dataset addressing limitations of existing copy-move forgery datasets.

### Vendi Novelty Scores for Out-of-Distribution Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10062v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10062v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10062v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10062v1)

2026/02/10 18:30 GTM

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning systems. Existing post-hoc detectors typically rely on model confidence scores or likelihood estimates in feature space, often under restrictive distributional assumptions. In this work, we introduce a third paradigm and formulate OOD detection from a diversity perspective. We propose the Vendi Novelty Score (VNS), an OOD detector based on the Vendi Scores (VS), a family of similarity-based diversity metrics. VNS quantifies how much a test sample increases the VS of the in-distribution feature set, providing a principled notion of novelty that does not require density modeling. VNS is linear-time, non-parametric, and naturally combines class-conditional (local) and dataset-level (global) novelty signals. Across multiple image classification benchmarks and network architectures, VNS achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance. Remarkably, VNS retains this performance when computed using only 1% of the training data, enabling deployment in memory- or access-constrained settings.

### Spatio-Temporal Attention for Consistent Video Semantic Segmentation in Automated Driving
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10052v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10052v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10052v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10052v1)

2026/02/10 18:18 GTM

Deep neural networks, especially transformer-based architectures, have achieved remarkable success in semantic segmentation for environmental perception. However, existing models process video frames independently, thus failing to leverage temporal consistency, which could significantly improve both accuracy and stability in dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism that extends transformer attention blocks to incorporate multi-frame context, enabling robust temporal feature representations for video semantic segmentation. Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines. These results demonstrate STA as an effective architectural enhancement for video-based semantic segmentation applications.

### Conformal Prediction Sets for Instance Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10045v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10045v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10045v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10045v1)

2026/02/10 18:15 GTM

Current instance segmentation models achieve high performance on average predictions, but lack principled uncertainty quantification: their outputs are not calibrated, and there is no guarantee that a predicted mask is close to the ground truth. To address this limitation, we introduce a conformal prediction algorithm to generate adaptive confidence sets for instance segmentation. Given an image and a pixel coordinate query, our algorithm generates a confidence set of instance predictions for that pixel, with a provable guarantee for the probability that at least one of the predictions has high Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) with the true object instance mask. We apply our algorithm to instance segmentation examples in agricultural field delineation, cell segmentation, and vehicle detection. Empirically, we find that our prediction sets vary in size based on query difficulty and attain the target coverage, outperforming existing baselines such as Learn Then Test, Conformal Risk Control, and morphological dilation-based methods. We provide versions of the algorithm with asymptotic and finite sample guarantees.

### Simple Image Processing and Similarity Measures Can Link Data Samples across Databases through Brain MRI
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10043v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10043v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10043v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10043v1)

Head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely collected and shared for research under strict regulatory frameworks. These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods.
  Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases. These results aim to contribute meaningfully to the development of thoughtful, forward-looking policies in medical data sharing.

### Fake-HR1: Rethinking reasoning of vision language model for synthetic image detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10042v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10042v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10042v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10042v1)

2026/02/10 18:10 GTM

Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the detection process can enhance a model's ability to detect synthetic images. However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency.

### Perception with Guarantees: Certified Pose Estimation via Reachability Analysis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10032v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10032v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10032v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10032v1)

2026/02/10 17:55 GTM

Agents in cyber-physical systems are increasingly entrusted with safety-critical tasks. Ensuring safety of these agents often requires localizing the pose for subsequent actions. Pose estimates can, e.g., be obtained from various combinations of lidar sensors, cameras, and external services such as GPS. Crucially, in safety-critical domains, a rough estimate is insufficient to formally determine safety, i.e., guaranteeing safety even in the worst-case scenario, and external services might additionally not be trustworthy. We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach efficiently and accurately localizes agents in both synthetic and real-world experiments.

### Faster-GS: Analyzing and Improving Gaussian Splatting Optimization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09999v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09999v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09999v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09999v1)

2026/02/10 17:22 GTM

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have focused on accelerating optimization while preserving reconstruction quality. However, many proposed methods entangle implementation-level improvements with fundamental algorithmic modifications or trade performance for fidelity, leading to a fragmented research landscape that complicates fair comparison. In this work, we consolidate and evaluate the most effective and broadly applicable strategies from prior 3DGS research and augment them with several novel optimizations. We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization.

### Efficient Special Stain Classification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09989v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09989v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09989v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09989v1)

Stains are essential in histopathology to visualize specific tissue characteristics, with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) serving as the clinical standard. However, pathologists frequently
  utilize a variety of special stains for the diagnosis of specific morphologies. Maintaining accurate metadata for these slides is critical for quality control in clinical archives and for
  the integrity of computational pathology datasets. In this work, we compare two approaches for automated classification of stains using whole slide images, covering the 14 most commonly
  used special stains in our institute alongside standard and frozen-section H&E. We evaluate a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline and a proposed lightweight thumbnail-based approach.
  On internal test data, MIL achieved the highest performance (macro F1: 0.941 for 16 classes; 0.969 for 14 merged classes), while the thumbnail approach remained competitive (0.897 and
  0.953, respectively). On external TCGA data, the thumbnail model generalized best (weighted F1: 0.843 vs. 0.807 for MIL). The thumbnail approach also increased throughput by two orders of
  magnitude (5.635 vs. 0.018 slides/s for MIL with all patches). We conclude that thumbnail-based classification provides a scalable and robust solution for routine visual quality control
  in digital pathology workflows.

### Online Monitoring Framework for Automotive Time Series Data using JEPA Embeddings
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09985v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09985v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09985v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09985v1)

As autonomous vehicles are rolled out, measures must be taken to ensure their safe operation. In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed. These run continuously online in the background, supervising the system status and recording anomalies. This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available. Experiments performed on the publicly available, real-world nuScenes dataset illustrate the framework's capabilities.

### Coupled Inference in Diffusion Models for Semantic Decomposition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09983v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09983v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09983v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09983v1)

2026/02/10 17:10 GTM

Many visual scenes can be described as compositions of latent factors. Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.

### Learning to Detect Baked Goods with Limited Supervision
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09979v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09979v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09979v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09979v1)

2026/02/10 17:06 GTM

Monitoring leftover products provides valuable insights that can be used to optimize future production. This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.

Urinary bladder cancer surveillance requires tracking tumor sites across repeated interventions, yet the deformable and hollow bladder lacks stable landmarks for orientation. While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific "vascular fingerprint" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models. Crucially, our method successfully suppresses false positives from mucosal folds that dynamically appear and vanish as the bladder fills and empties during surgery. Hence, HAC provides the reliable structural stability required for clinical navigation.

### VersaViT: Enhancing MLLM Vision Backbones via Task-Guided Optimization

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in visual-language understanding, demonstrating superior high-level semantic alignment within their vision encoders. An important question thus arises: Can these encoders serve as versatile vision backbones, capable of reliably performing classic vision-centric tasks as well? To address the question, we make the following contributions: (i) we identify that the vision encoders within MLLMs exhibit deficiencies in their dense feature representations, as evidenced by their suboptimal performance on dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, depth estimation); (ii) we propose VersaViT, a well-rounded vision transformer that instantiates a novel multi-task framework for collaborative post-training. This framework facilitates the optimization of the vision backbone via lightweight task heads with multi-granularity supervision; (iii) extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding a versatile vision backbone suited for both language-mediated reasoning and pixel-level understanding.

### Unbalanced optimal transport for robust longitudinal lesion evolution with registration-aware and appearance-guided priors
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09933v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09933v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09933v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09933v1)

Evaluating lesion evolution in longitudinal CT scans of can cer patients is essential for assessing treatment response, yet establishing reliable lesion correspondence across time remains challenging. Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes. Our transport cost blends (i) size-normalized geometry, (ii) local registration trust from the deformation-field Jacobian, and (iii) optional patch-level appearance consistency. The resulting transport plan is sparsified by relative pruning, yielding one-to-one matches as well as new, disappearing, merging, and splitting lesions without retraining or heuristic rules. On longitudinal CT data, our approach achieves consistently higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores versus distance-only baselines.

### GeoFormer: A Swin Transformer-Based Framework for Scene-Level Building Height and Footprint Estimation from Sentinel Imagery

Accurate three-dimensional urban data are critical for climate modelling, disaster risk assessment, and urban planning, yet remain scarce due to reliance on proprietary sensors or poor cross-city generalisation. We propose GeoFormer, an open-source Swin Transformer framework that jointly estimates building height (BH) and footprint (BF) on a 100 m grid using only Sentinel-1/2 imagery and open DEM data. A geo-blocked splitting strategy ensures strict spatial independence between training and test sets. Evaluated over 54 diverse cities, GeoFormer achieves a BH RMSE of 3.19 m and a BF RMSE of 0.05, improving 7.5% and 15.3% over the strongest CNN baseline, while maintaining under 3.5 m BH RMSE in cross-continent transfer. Ablation studies confirm that DEM is indispensable for height estimation and that optical reflectance dominates over SAR, though multi-source fusion yields the best overall accuracy. All code, weights, and global products are publicly released.

### Monocular Normal Estimation via Shading Sequence Estimation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09929v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09929v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09929v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09929v1)

Monocular normal estimation aims to estimate the normal map from a single RGB image of an object under arbitrary lights. Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.

### A benchmark for video-based laparoscopic skill analysis and assessment

Laparoscopic surgery is a complex surgical technique that requires extensive training. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in supporting this training by enabling automatic video-based assessment of surgical skills. However, the development and evaluation of deep learning models is currently hindered by the limited size of available annotated datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Laparoscopic Skill Analysis and Assessment (LASANA) dataset, comprising 1270 stereo video recordings of four basic laparoscopic training tasks. Each recording is annotated with a structured skill rating, aggregated from three independent raters, as well as binary labels indicating the presence or absence of task-specific errors. The majority of recordings originate from a laparoscopic training course, thereby reflecting a natural variation in the skill of participants. To facilitate benchmarking of both existing and novel approaches for video-based skill assessment and error recognition, we provide predefined data splits for each task. Furthermore, we present baseline results from a deep learning model as a reference point for future comparisons.

### SARS: A Novel Face and Body Shape and Appearance Aware 3D Reconstruction System extends Morphable Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09918v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09918v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09918v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09918v1)

Morphable Models (3DMMs) are a type of morphable model that takes 2D images as inputs and recreates the structure and physical appearance of 3D objects, especially human faces and bodies. 3DMM combines identity and expression blendshapes with a basic face mesh to create a detailed 3D model. The variability in the 3D Morphable models can be controlled by tuning diverse parameters. They are high-level image descriptors, such as shape, texture, illumination, and camera parameters. Previous research in 3D human reconstruction concentrated solely on global face structure or geometry, ignoring face semantic features such as age, gender, and facial landmarks characterizing facial boundaries, curves, dips, and wrinkles. In order to accommodate changes in these high-level facial characteristics, this work introduces a shape and appearance-aware 3D reconstruction system (named SARS by us), a c modular pipeline that extracts body and face information from a single image to properly rebuild the 3D model of the human full body.

### AdaTSQ: Pushing the Pareto Frontier of Diffusion Transformers via Temporal-Sensitivity Quantization

Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation. However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Qiushao-E/AdaTSQ.

### MVISTA-4D: View-Consistent 4D World Model with Test-Time Action Inference for Robotic Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09878v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09878v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09878v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09878v1)

2026/02/10 15:19 GTM

World-model-based imagine-then-act becomes a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, yet existing approaches typically support either purely image-based forecasting or reasoning over partial 3D geometry, limiting their ability to predict complete 4D scene dynamics. This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.

### BabyMamba-HAR: Lightweight Selective State Space Models for Efficient Human Activity Recognition on Resource Constrained Devices
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09872v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09872v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09872v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09872v1)

Human activity recognition (HAR) on wearable and mobile devices is constrained by memory footprint and computational budget, yet competitive accuracy must be maintained across heterogeneous sensor configurations. Selective state space models (SSMs) offer linear time sequence processing with input dependent gating, presenting a compelling alternative to quadratic complexity attention mechanisms. However, the design space for deploying SSMs in the TinyML regime remains largely unexplored. In this paper, BabyMamba-HAR is introduced, a framework comprising two novel lightweight Mamba inspired architectures optimized for resource constrained HAR: (1) CI-BabyMamba-HAR, using a channel independent stem that processes each sensor channel through shared weight, but instance independent transformations to prevent cross channel noise propagation, and (2) Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR, using an early fusion stem that achieves channel count independent computational complexity. Both variants incorporate weight tied bidirectional scanning and lightweight temporal attention pooling. Through evaluation across eight diverse benchmarks, it is demonstrated that Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR achieves 86.52% average macro F1-score with approximately 27K parameters and 2.21M MACs, matching TinyHAR (86.16%) while requiring 11x fewer MACs on high channel datasets. Systematic ablation studies reveal that bidirectional scanning contributes up to 8.42% F1-score improvement, and gated temporal attention provides up to 8.94% F1-score gain over mean pooling. These findings establish practical design principles for deploying selective state space models as efficient TinyML backbones for HAR.

### Free-GVC: Towards Training-Free Extreme Generative Video Compression with Temporal Coherence

Building on recent advances in video generation, generative video compression has emerged as a new paradigm for achieving visually pleasing reconstructions. However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.

### Code2World: A GUI World Model via Renderable Code Generation

Autonomous GUI agents interact with environments by perceiving interfaces and executing actions. As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction. However, existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability. To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation. The code is available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/Code2World.

### Reason-IAD: Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Latent Reasoning for Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09850v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09850v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09850v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09850v1)

Industrial anomaly detection demands precise reasoning over fine-grained defect patterns. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), pretrained on general-domain data, often struggle to capture category-specific anomalies, thereby limiting both detection accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-IAD, a knowledge-guided dynamic latent reasoning framework for explainable industrial anomaly detection. Reason-IAD comprises two core components. First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chenpeng052/Reason-IAD.

Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.

### ARK: A Dual-Axis Multimodal Retrieval Benchmark along Reasoning and Knowledge
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09839v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09839v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09839v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09839v1)

Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks largely emphasize semantic matching on daily-life images and offer limited diagnostics of professional knowledge and complex reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks. We further show that simple enhancements such as re-ranking and rewriting yield consistent improvements, but substantial headroom remains.

### SAKED: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Stability-Aware Knowledge Enhanced Decoding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09825v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09825v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09825v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09825v1)

2026/02/10 14:33 GTM

Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) pose significant security and reliability risks in real-world applications. Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAKED achieves state-of-the-art performance for hallucination mitigation on various models, tasks, and benchmarks.

### CompSplat: Compression-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-world Video
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09816v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09816v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09816v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09816v1)

High-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) from real-world videos is crucial for applications such as cultural heritage preservation, digital twins, and immersive media. However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.

### SciFlow-Bench: Evaluating Structure-Aware Scientific Diagram Generation via Inverse Parsing

Scientific diagrams convey explicit structural information, yet modern text-to-image models often produce visually plausible but structurally incorrect results. Existing benchmarks either rely on image-centric or subjective metrics insensitive to structure, or evaluate intermediate symbolic representations rather than final rendered images, leaving pixel-based diagram generation underexplored. We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation.

### Where Do Images Come From? Analyzing Captions to Geographically Profile Datasets

Recent studies show that text-to-image models often fail to generate geographically representative images, raising concerns about the representativeness of their training data and motivating the question: which parts of the world do these training examples come from? We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\%$ and $3.8\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($ρ= 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images.

### Self-Supervised Learning as Discrete Communication
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09764v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09764v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09764v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09764v1)

Most self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learn continuous visual representations by aligning different views of the same input, offering limited control over how information is structured across representation dimensions. In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over continuous agreement baselines on image classification, retrieval, and dense visual prediction tasks, as well as under domain shift through self-supervised adaptation. Beyond backbone representations, we analyze the learned binary codes and show that they form a compact and informative discrete language, capturing semantic factors reusable across classes.

This article investigates the robustness of vision systems in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which is critical for developing Level-5 autonomous driving capabilities. Safe and reliable CAV navigation undeniably depends on robust vision systems that enable accurate detection of objects, lane markings, and traffic signage. We analyze the key sensors and vision components essential for CAV navigation to derive a reference architecture for CAV vision system (CAVVS). This reference architecture provides a basis for identifying potential attack surfaces of CAVVS. Subsequently, we elaborate on identified attack vectors targeting each attack surface, rigorously evaluating their implications for confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of attack vector dynamics in vision systems, which is crucial for formulating robust security measures that can uphold the principles of the CIA triad.

### Toward Fine-Grained Facial Control in 3D Talking Head Generation

Audio-driven talking head generation is a core component of digital avatars, and 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown strong performance in real-time rendering of high-fidelity talking heads. However, achieving precise control over fine-grained facial movements remains a significant challenge, particularly due to lip-synchronization inaccuracies and facial jitter, both of which can contribute to the uncanny valley effect. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting (FG-3DGS), a novel framework that enables temporally consistent and high-fidelity talking head generation. Our method introduces a frequency-aware disentanglement strategy to explicitly model facial regions based on their motion characteristics. Low-frequency regions, such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead, are jointly modeled using a standard MLP, while high-frequency regions, including the eyes and mouth, are captured separately using a dedicated network guided by facial area masks. The predicted motion dynamics, represented as Gaussian deltas, are applied to the static Gaussians to generate the final head frames, which are rendered via a rasterizer using frame-specific camera parameters. Additionally, a high-frequency-refined post-rendering alignment mechanism, learned from large-scale audio-video pairs by a pretrained model, is incorporated to enhance per-frame generation and achieve more accurate lip synchronization. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets for talking head generation demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos.

### Allure of Craquelure: A Variational-Generative Approach to Crack Detection in Paintings
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09730v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09730v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09730v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09730v1)

Recent advances in imaging technologies, deep learning and numerical performance have enabled non-invasive detailed analysis of artworks, supporting their documentation and conservation. In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.

### From Lightweight CNNs to SpikeNets: Benchmarking Accuracy-Energy Tradeoffs with Pruned Spiking SqueezeNet
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09717v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09717v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09717v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09717v1)

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly studied as energy-efficient alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly for edge intelligence. However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.

### Stroke3D: Lifting 2D strokes into rigged 3D model via latent diffusion models

Rigged 3D assets are fundamental to 3D deformation and animation. However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.

### Physics-informed diffusion models in spectral space
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09708v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09708v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09708v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09708v1)

We propose a methodology that combines generative latent diffusion models with physics-informed machine learning to generate solutions of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) conditioned on partial observations, which includes, in particular, forward and inverse PDE problems. We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations. Code is available at https://github.com/deeplearningmethods/PISD.

### GenSeg-R1: RL-Driven Vision-Language Grounding for Fine-Grained Referring Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09701v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09701v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09701v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09701v1)

We study fine-grained referring image segmentation via a decoupled reason-then-segment pipeline. A vision-language model (VLM) receives an image and a natural-language query, reasons about the scene, and emits structured spatial prompts: a bounding box plus two interior keypoints for every referred instance. A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks.
  Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations. On RefCOCOg validation our best model (GenSeg-R1-8B) achieves 0.7127 cIoU and 0.7382 mIoU, substantially outperforming the corresponding Qwen3-VL Instruct baselines (+15.3 and +21.9 points, respectively) and surpassing Seg-Zero-7B [3] by +3.3 cIoU under identical evaluation.
  We further introduce GenSeg-R1-G, a variant trained on GRefCOCO [9] with a SAM 2 in-the-loop reward that directly optimizes mask quality. On GRefCOCO validation GenSeg-R1-G achieves 76.69% target mIoU with 82.40% accuracy on negative (no-target) prompts, substantially outperforming Seg-R1-7B and Seg-Zero-7B, which lack no-target detection capability. On ReasonSeg test, GenSeg-R1-4B reaches 68.40% mIoU, surpassing Seg-Zero-7B by +7.0 and Seg-R1-7B by +10.7 points.

### Semi-supervised Liver Segmentation and Patch-based Fibrosis Staging with Registration-aided Multi-parametric MRI

Liver fibrosis poses a substantial challenge in clinical practice, emphasizing the necessity for precise liver segmentation and accurate disease staging. Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4). The code is freely available. Github link: https://github.com/mileywang3061/Care-Liver

### TreeCUA: Efficiently Scaling GUI Automation with Tree-Structured Verifiable Evolution
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09662v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09662v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09662v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09662v1)

Effectively scaling GUI automation is essential for computer-use agents (CUAs); however, existing work primarily focuses on scaling GUI grounding rather than the more crucial GUI planning, which requires more sophisticated data collection. In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization. All trajectory node information and code will be available at https://github.com/UITron-hub/TreeCUA.

### Time2General: Learning Spatiotemporal Invariant Representations for Domain-Generalization Video Semantic Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09648v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09648v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09648v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09648v1)

Domain Generalized Video Semantic Segmentation (DGVSS) is trained on a single labeled driving domain and is directly deployed on unseen domains without target labels and test-time adaptation while maintaining temporally consistent predictions over video streams. In practice, both domain shift and temporal-sampling shift break correspondence-based propagation and fixed-stride temporal aggregation, causing severe frame-to-frame flicker even in label-stable regions. We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS. Code will be released after the review process.

### VideoAfford: Grounding 3D Affordance from Human-Object-Interaction Videos via Multimodal Large Language Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09638v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09638v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09638v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09638v1)

3D affordance grounding aims to highlight the actionable regions on 3D objects, which is crucial for robotic manipulation. Previous research primarily focused on learning affordance knowledge from static cues such as language and images, which struggle to provide sufficient dynamic interaction context that can reveal temporal and causal cues. To alleviate this predicament, we collect a comprehensive video-based 3D affordance dataset, \textit{VIDA}, which contains 38K human-object-interaction videos covering 16 affordance types, 38 object categories, and 22K point clouds. Based on \textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms well-established methods and exhibits strong open-world generalization with affordance reasoning abilities. All datasets and code will be publicly released to advance research in this area.

### Towards Training-free Multimodal Hate Localisation with Large Language Models

The proliferation of hateful content in online videos poses severe threats to individual well-being and societal harmony. However, existing solutions for video hate detection either rely heavily on large-scale human annotations or lack fine-grained temporal precision. In this work, we propose LELA, the first training-free Large Language Model (LLM) based framework for hate video localization. Distinct from state-of-the-art models that depend on supervised pipelines, LELA leverages LLMs and modality-specific captioning to detect and temporally localize hateful content in a training-free manner. Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame. We further introduce a composition matching mechanism to enhance cross-modal reasoning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, HateMM and MultiHateClip, demonstrate that LELA outperforms all existing training-free baselines by a large margin. We also provide extensive ablations and qualitative visualizations, establishing LELA as a strong foundation for scalable and interpretable hate video localization.

### AnyTouch 2: General Optical Tactile Representation Learning For Dynamic Tactile Perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09617v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09617v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09617v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09617v1)

Real-world contact-rich manipulation demands robots to perceive temporal tactile feedback, capture subtle surface deformations, and reason about object properties as well as force dynamics. Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate consistent and strong performance across sensors and tasks.

### AGMark: Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking for Large Vision-Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09611v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09611v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09611v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09611v1)

Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.

### Tele-Omni: a Unified Multimodal Framework for Video Generation and Editing

Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.

### Hand2World: Autoregressive Egocentric Interaction Generation via Free-Space Hand Gestures
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09600v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09600v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09600v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09600v1)

2026/02/10 09:51 GTM

Egocentric interactive world models are essential for augmented reality and embodied AI, where visual generation must respond to user input with low latency, geometric consistency, and long-term stability. We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.

### MieDB-100k: A Comprehensive Dataset for Medical Image Editing

The scarcity of high-quality data remains a primary bottleneck in adapting multimodal generative models for medical image editing. Existing medical image editing datasets often suffer from limited diversity, neglect of medical image understanding and inability to balance quality with scalability. To address these gaps, we propose MieDB-100k, a large-scale, high-quality and diverse dataset for text-guided medical image editing. It categorizes editing tasks into perspectives of Perception, Modification and Transformation, considering both understanding and generation abilities. We construct MieDB-100k via a data curation pipeline leveraging both modality-specific expert models and rule-based data synthetic methods, followed by rigorous manual inspection to ensure clinical fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that model trained with MieDB-100k consistently outperform both open-source and proprietary models while exhibiting strong generalization ability. We anticipate that this dataset will serve as a cornerstone for future advancements in specialized medical image editing.

### Delving into Spectral Clustering with Vision-Language Representations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09586v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09586v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09586v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09586v1)

Spectral clustering is known as a powerful technique in unsupervised data analysis. The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts. Extensive experiments on \textbf{16} benchmarks -- including classical, large-scale, fine-grained and domain-shifted datasets -- manifest that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

### ECG-IMN: Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Networks for 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Interpretation

Deep learning has achieved expert-level performance in automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, yet the "black-box" nature of these models hinders their clinical deployment. Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward "white-box" cardiac diagnostics.

### Scalpel: Fine-Grained Alignment of Attention Activation Manifolds via Mixture Gaussian Bridges to Mitigate Multimodal Hallucination

Rapid progress in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has achieved unprecedented performance in vision-language tasks. However, due to the strong prior of large language models (LLMs) and misaligned attention across modalities, LVLMs often generate outputs inconsistent with visual content - termed hallucination. To address this, we propose \textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schrödinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step.

### AUHead: Realistic Emotional Talking Head Generation via Action Units Control
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09534v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09534v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09534v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09534v1)

Realistic talking-head video generation is critical for virtual avatars, film production, and interactive systems. Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an "emotion-then-AU" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/laura990501/AUHead_ICLR

### RAD: Retrieval-Augmented Monocular Metric Depth Estimation for Underrepresented Classes
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09532v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09532v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09532v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09532v1)

2026/02/10 08:44 GTM

Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) is essential for physically intelligent systems, yet accurate depth estimation for underrepresented classes in complex scenes remains a persistent challenge. To address this, we propose RAD, a retrieval-augmented framework that approximates the benefits of multi-view stereo by utilizing retrieved neighbors as structural geometric proxies. Our method first employs an uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanism to identify low-confidence regions in the input and retrieve RGB-D context samples containing semantically similar content. We then process both the input and retrieved context via a dual-stream network and fuse them using a matched cross-attention module, which transfers geometric information only at reliable point correspondences. Evaluations on NYU Depth v2, KITTI, and Cityscapes demonstrate that RAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on underrepresented classes, reducing relative absolute error by 29.2% on NYU Depth v2, 13.3% on KITTI, and 7.2% on Cityscapes, while maintaining competitive performance on standard in-domain benchmarks.

### DR.Experts: Differential Refinement of Distortion-Aware Experts for Blind Image Quality Assessment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09531v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09531v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09531v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09531v1)

2026/02/10 08:41 GTM

Blind Image Quality Assessment, aiming to replicate human perception of visual quality without reference, plays a key role in vision tasks, yet existing models often fail to effectively capture subtle distortion cues, leading to a misalignment with human subjective judgments. We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module. This mechanism weights each distortion-specific feature as per its perceptual impact, ensuring that the final quality prediction aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging BIQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DR.Experts over current methods and showcase its excellence in terms of generalization and data efficiency.

### SCA-Net: Spatial-Contextual Aggregation Network for Enhanced Small Building and Road Change Detection

Automated change detection in remote sensing imagery is critical for urban management, environmental monitoring, and disaster assessment. While deep learning models have advanced this field, they often struggle with challenges like low sensitivity to small objects and high computational costs. This paper presents SCA-Net, an enhanced architecture built upon the Change-Agent framework for precise building and road change detection in bi-temporal images. Our model incorporates several key innovations: a novel Difference Pyramid Block for multi-scale change analysis, an Adaptive Multi-scale Processing module combining shape-aware and high-resolution enhancement blocks, and multi-level attention mechanisms (PPM and CSAGate) for joint contextual and detail processing. Furthermore, a dynamic composite loss function and a four-phase training strategy are introduced to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. Comprehensive evaluations on the LEVIR-CD and LEVIR-MCI datasets demonstrate SCA-Net's superior performance over Change-Agent and other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a significant 2.64% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on LEVIR-MCI and a remarkable 57.9% increase in IoU for small buildings, while reducing the training time by 61%. This work provides an efficient, accurate, and robust solution for practical change detection applications.

### SchröMind: Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models via Solving the Schrödinger Bridge Problem

Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, their use in high-stakes fields like healthcare remains limited due to persistent hallucinations, where generated text contradicts or ignores visual input. We contend that MLLMs can comprehend images but struggle to produce accurate token sequences. Minor perturbations can shift attention from truthful to untruthful states, and the autoregressive nature of text generation often prevents error correction. To address this, we propose SchröMind-a novel framework reducing hallucinations via solving the Schrödinger bridge problem. It establishes a token-level mapping between hallucinatory and truthful activations with minimal transport cost through lightweight training, while preserving the model's original capabilities. Extensive experiments on the POPE and MME benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Schrödinger, which achieves state-of-the-art performance while introducing only minimal computational overhead.

### HLGFA: High-Low Resolution Guided Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09524v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09524v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09524v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09524v1)

2026/02/10 08:27 GTM

Unsupervised industrial anomaly detection (UAD) is essential for modern manufacturing inspection, where defect samples are scarce and reliable detection is required. In this paper, we propose HLGFA, a high-low resolution guided feature alignment framework that learns normality by modeling cross-resolution feature consistency between high-resolution and low-resolution representations of normal samples, instead of relying on pixel-level reconstruction. Dual-resolution inputs are processed by a shared frozen backbone to extract multi-level features, and high-resolution representations are decomposed into structure and detail priors to guide the refinement of low-resolution features through conditional modulation and gated residual correction. During inference, anomalies are naturally identified as regions where cross-resolution alignment breaks down. In addition, a noise-aware data augmentation strategy is introduced to suppress nuisance-induced responses commonly observed in industrial environments. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HLGFA, achieving 97.9% pixel-level AUROC and 97.5% image-level AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset, outperforming representative reconstruction-based and feature-based methods.

### Singpath-VL Technical Report
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09523v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09523v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09523v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09523v1)

We present Singpath-VL, a vision-language large model, to fill the vacancy of AI assistant in cervical cytology. Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly propelled the field of computational pathology. However, their application in cytopathology, particularly cervical cytology, remains underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology. Using this dataset, we then fine-tune the Qwen3-VL-4B model via a multi-stage strategy to create a specialized cytopathology MLLM. The resulting model, named Singpath-VL, demonstrates superior performance in fine-grained morphological perception and cell-level diagnostic classification. To advance the field, we will open-source a portion of the synthetic dataset and benchmark.

### Attention to details, logits to truth: visual-aware attention and logits enhancement to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09521v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09521v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09521v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09521v1)

2026/02/10 08:26 GTM

Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit insufficient visual attention, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method significantly reduces hallucinations across mainstream LVLMs, while preserving the accuracy and coherence of generated content.

### A Universal Action Space for General Behavior Analysis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09518v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09518v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09518v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09518v1)

Analyzing animal and human behavior has long been a challenging task in computer vision. Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets. The source code is released on GitHub at https://github.com/franktpmvu/Universal-Action-Space.

### Energy-Efficient Fast Object Detection on Edge Devices for IoT Systems

This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) application that utilizes an AI classifier for fast-object detection using the frame difference method. This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.

### Robust Depth Super-Resolution via Adaptive Diffusion Sampling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09510v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09510v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09510v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09510v1)

2026/02/10 08:10 GTM

We propose AdaDS, a generalizable framework for depth super-resolution that robustly recovers high-resolution depth maps from arbitrarily degraded low-resolution inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Equilibrium contrastive learning for imbalanced image classification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09506v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09506v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09506v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09506v1)

2026/02/10 08:07 GTM

Contrastive learning (CL) is a predominant technique in image classification, but they showed limited performance with an imbalanced dataset. Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset. Results show that ECL outperforms existing SOTA supervised CL methods designed for imbalanced classification.

### OSI: One-step Inversion Excels in Extracting Diffusion Watermarks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09494v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09494v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09494v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09494v1)

2026/02/10 07:43 GTM

Watermarking is an important mechanism for provenance and copyright protection of diffusion-generated images. Training-free methods, exemplified by Gaussian Shading, embed watermarks into the initial noise of diffusion models with negligible impact on the quality of generated images. However, extracting this type of watermark typically requires multi-step diffusion inversion to obtain precise initial noise, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose One-step Inversion (OSI), a significantly faster and more accurate method for extracting Gaussian Shading style watermarks. OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a learnable sign classification problem, which eliminates the need for precise regression of the initial noise. Then, we initialize the OSI model from the diffusion backbone and finetune it on synthesized noise-image pairs with a sign classification objective. In this manner, the OSI model is able to accomplish the watermark extraction efficiently in only one step. Our OSI substantially outperforms the multi-step diffusion inversion method: it is 20x faster, achieves higher extraction accuracy, and doubles the watermark payload capacity. Extensive experiments across diverse schedulers, diffusion backbones, and cryptographic schemes consistently show improvements, demonstrating the generality of our OSI framework.

### Beyond Next-Token Alignment: Distilling Multimodal Large Language Models via Token Interactions
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09483v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09483v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09483v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09483v1)

2026/02/10 07:26 GTM

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal capabilities, yet their substantial size poses significant deployment challenges. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI.

### Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning for Histopathology Patch Embeddings
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09477v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09477v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09477v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09477v1)

2026/02/10 07:17 GTM

Digital histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) provide gigapixel-scale high-resolution images that are highly useful for disease diagnosis. However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected.
  In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets. Our related code is available at github.com/BzhangURU/Paper_WeakSupCon_for_MIL

### FD-DB: Frequency-Decoupled Dual-Branch Network for Unpaired Synthetic-to-Real Domain Translation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09476v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09476v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09476v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09476v1)

2026/02/10 07:16 GTM

Synthetic data provide low-cost, accurately annotated samples for geometry-sensitive vision tasks, but appearance and imaging differences between synthetic and real domains cause severe domain shift and degrade downstream performance. Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.

### ArtifactLens: Hundreds of Labels Are Enough for Artifact Detection with VLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09475v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09475v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09475v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09475v1)

2026/02/10 07:16 GTM

Modern image generators produce strikingly realistic images, where only artifacts like distorted hands or warped objects reveal their synthetic origin. Detecting these artifacts is essential: without detection, we cannot benchmark generators or train reward models to improve them. Current detectors fine-tune VLMs on tens of thousands of labeled images, but this is expensive to repeat whenever generators evolve or new artifact types emerge. We show that pretrained VLMs already encode the knowledge needed to detect artifacts - with the right scaffolding, this capability can be unlocked using only a few hundred labeled examples per artifact category. Our system, ArtifactLens, achieves state-of-the-art on five human artifact benchmarks (the first evaluation across multiple datasets) while requiring orders of magnitude less labeled data. The scaffolding consists of a multi-component architecture with in-context learning and text instruction optimization, with novel improvements to each. Our methods generalize to other artifact types - object morphology, animal anatomy, and entity interactions - and to the distinct task of AIGC detection.

### LLM-Grounded Dynamic Task Planning with Hierarchical Temporal Logic for Human-Aware Multi-Robot Collaboration
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09472v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09472v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09472v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09472v1)

2026/02/10 07:11 GTM

While Large Language Models (LLM) enable non-experts to specify open-world multi-robot tasks, the generated plans often lack kinematic feasibility and are not efficient, especially in long-horizon scenarios. Formal methods like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offer correctness and optimal guarantees, but are typically confined to static, offline settings and struggle with computational scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning into hierarchical LTL specifications and solves the corresponding Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning (STAP) problem. Unlike static approaches, our system resolves stochastic environmental changes, such as moving users or updated instructions via a receding horizon planning (RHP) loop with real-time perception, which dynamically refines plans through a hierarchical state space. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in success rate and interaction fluency while minimizing planning latency.

### Look-Ahead and Look-Back Flows: Training-Free Image Generation with Trajectory Smoothing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09449v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09449v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09449v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09449v1)

Recent advances have reformulated diffusion models as deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through the framework of flow matching, providing a unified formulation for the noise-to-data generative process. Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluation metrics that the proposed training-free trajectory smoothing models substantially outperform various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets including COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.

### A Scoping Review of Deep Learning for Urban Visual Pollution and Proposal of a Real-Time Monitoring Framework with a Visual Pollution Index
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09446v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09446v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09446v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09446v1)

Urban Visual Pollution (UVP) has emerged as a critical concern, yet research on automatic detection and application remains fragmented. This scoping review maps the existing deep learning-based approaches for detecting, classifying, and designing a comprehensive application framework for visual pollution management. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, seven academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, ScienceDirect, SpringerNatureLink, and Wiley) were systematically searched and reviewed, and 26 articles were found. Most research focuses on specific pollutant categories and employs variations of YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet architectures. Although several datasets exist, they are limited to specific areas and lack standardized taxonomies. Few studies integrate detection into real-time application systems, yet they tend to be geographically skewed. We proposed a framework for monitoring visual pollution that integrates a visual pollution index to assess the severity of visual pollution for a certain area. This review highlights the need for a unified UVP management system that incorporates pollutant taxonomy, a cross-city benchmark dataset, a generalized deep learning model, and an assessment index that supports sustainable urban aesthetics and enhances the well-being of urban dwellers.

### Fine-T2I: An Open, Large-Scale, and Diverse Dataset for High-Quality T2I Fine-Tuning

High-quality and open datasets remain a major bottleneck for text-to-image (T2I) fine-tuning. Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community.

### Quantum-Audit: Evaluating the Reasoning Limits of LLMs on Quantum Computing

Language models have become practical tools for quantum computing education and research, from summarizing technical papers to explaining theoretical concepts and answering questions about recent developments in the field. While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%. Top-performing models exceeded the expert average, with Claude Opus 4.5 reaching 84% accuracy, though top models showed an average 12-point accuracy drop on expert-written questions compared to LLM-generated ones. Performance declined further on advanced topics, dropping to 73% on security questions. Additionally, models frequently accepted and reinforced false premises embedded in questions instead of identifying them, with accuracy below 66% on these critical reasoning tasks.

### Agent World Model: Infinity Synthetic Environments for Agentic Reinforcement Learning

Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization. The code is available at https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/agent-world-model.

### Anagent For Enhancing Scientific Table & Figure Analysis

In scientific research, analysis requires accurately interpreting complex multimodal knowledge, integrating evidence from different sources, and drawing inferences grounded in domain-specific knowledge. However, current artificial intelligence (AI) systems struggle to consistently demonstrate such capabilities. The complexity and variability of scientific tables and figures, combined with heterogeneous structures and long-context requirements, pose fundamental obstacles to scientific table \& figure analysis. To quantify these challenges, we introduce AnaBench, a large-scale benchmark featuring $63,178$ instances from nine scientific domains, systematically categorized along seven complexity dimensions. To tackle these challenges, we propose Anagent, a multi-agent framework for enhanced scientific table \& figure analysis through four specialized agents: Planner decomposes tasks into actionable subtasks, Expert retrieves task-specific information through targeted tool execution, Solver synthesizes information to generate coherent analysis, and Critic performs iterative refinement through five-dimensional quality assessment. We further develop modular training strategies that leverage supervised finetuning and specialized reinforcement learning to optimize individual capabilities while maintaining effective collaboration. Comprehensive evaluation across 170 subdomains demonstrates that Anagent achieves substantial improvements, up to $\uparrow 13.43\%$ in training-free settings and $\uparrow 42.12\%$ with finetuning, while revealing that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific table \& figure analysis.

### CAPID: Context-Aware PII Detection for Question-Answering Systems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10074v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10074v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10074v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10074v1)

Detecting personally identifiable information (PII) in user queries is critical for ensuring privacy in question-answering systems. Current approaches mainly redact all PII, disregarding the fact that some of them may be contextually relevant to the user's question, resulting in a degradation of response quality. Large language models (LLMs) might be able to help determine which PII are relevant, but due to their closed source nature and lack of privacy guarantees, they are unsuitable for sensitive data processing. To achieve privacy-preserving PII detection, we propose CAPID, a practical approach that fine-tunes a locally owned small language model (SLM) that filters sensitive information before it is passed to LLMs for QA. However, existing datasets do not capture the context-dependent relevance of PII needed to train such a model effectively. To fill this gap, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages LLMs to produce a diverse, domain-rich dataset spanning multiple PII types and relevance levels. Using this dataset, we fine-tune an SLM to detect PII spans, classify their types, and estimate contextual relevance. Our experiments show that relevance-aware PII detection with a fine-tuned SLM substantially outperforms existing baselines in span, relevance and type accuracy while preserving significantly higher downstream utility under anonymization.

The principal goal of the RAG TREC Instrument for Multilingual Evaluation (RAGTIME) track at TREC is to study report generation from multilingual source documents. The track has created a document collection containing Arabic, Chinese, English, and Russian news stories. RAGTIME includes three task types: Multilingual Report Generation, English Report Generation, and Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR). A total of 125 runs were submitted by 13 participating teams (and as baselines by the track coordinators) for three tasks. This overview describes these three tasks and presents the available results.

### MEVER: Multi-Modal and Explainable Claim Verification with Graph-based Evidence Retrieval
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10023v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10023v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10023v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10023v1)

Verifying the truthfulness of claims usually requires joint multi-modal reasoning over both textual and visual evidence, such as analyzing both textual caption and chart image for claim verification. In addition, to make the reasoning process transparent, a textual explanation is necessary to justify the verification result. However, most claim verification works mainly focus on the reasoning over textual evidence only or ignore the explainability, resulting in inaccurate and unconvincing verification. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that jointly achieves evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation. For evidence retrieval, we construct a two-layer multi-modal graph for claims and evidence, where we design image-to-text and text-to-image reasoning for multi-modal retrieval. For claim verification, we propose token- and evidence-level fusion to integrate claim and evidence embeddings for multi-modal verification. For explanation generation, we introduce multi-modal Fusion-in-Decoder for explainability. Finally, since almost all the datasets are in general domain, we create a scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, in AI domain to complement claim verification community. Experiments show the strength of our model.

### Decoupled Reasoning with Implicit Fact Tokens (DRIFT): A Dual-Model Framework for Efficient Long-Context Inference

The integration of extensive, dynamic knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to the inherent entanglement of factual data and reasoning patterns. Existing solutions, ranging from non-parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to parametric knowledge editing, are often constrained in practice by finite context windows, retriever noise, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/DRIFT.

### SCORE: Specificity, Context Utilization, Robustness, and Relevance for Reference-Free LLM Evaluation

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support question answering and decision-making in high-stakes, domain-specific settings such as natural hazard response and infrastructure planning, where effective answers must convey fine-grained, decision-critical details. However, existing evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and open-ended question answering primarily rely on surface-level similarity, factual consistency, or semantic relevance, and often fail to assess whether responses provide the specific information required for domain-sensitive decisions. To address this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs along four complementary dimensions: specificity, robustness to paraphrasing and semantic perturbations, answer relevance, and context utilization. We introduce a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs spanning 40 professional roles and seven natural hazard types to support systematic evaluation. We further conduct human evaluation to assess inter-annotator agreement and alignment between model outputs and human judgments, which highlights the inherent subjectivity of open-ended, domain-specific evaluation. Our results show that no single metric sufficiently captures answer quality in isolation and demonstrate the need for structured, multi-metric evaluation frameworks when deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications.

### ViSpeechFormer: A Phonemic Approach for Vietnamese Automatic Speech Recognition

Vietnamese has a phonetic orthography, where each grapheme corresponds to at most one phoneme and vice versa. Exploiting this high grapheme-phoneme transparency, we propose ViSpeechFormer (\textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Speech} Trans\textbf{Former}), a phoneme-based approach for Vietnamese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Vietnamese ASR framework that explicitly models phonemic representations. Experiments on two publicly available Vietnamese ASR datasets show that ViSpeechFormer achieves strong performance, generalizes better to out-of-vocabulary words, and is less affected by training bias. This phoneme-based paradigm is also promising for other languages with phonetic orthographies. The code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

### A Unified Assessment of the Poverty of the Stimulus Argument for Neural Language Models

How can children acquire native-level syntax from limited input? According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here.

### ViMultiChoice: Toward a Method That Gives Explanation for Multiple-Choice Reading Comprehension in Vietnamese
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09961v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09961v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09961v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09961v1)

Multiple-choice Reading Comprehension (MCRC) models aim to select the correct answer from a set of candidate options for a given question. However, they typically lack the ability to explain the reasoning behind their choices. In this paper, we introduce a novel Vietnamese dataset designed to train and evaluate MCRC models with explanation generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose ViMultiChoice, a new method specifically designed for modeling Vietnamese reading comprehension that jointly predicts the correct answer and generates a corresponding explanation. Experimental results demonstrate that ViMultiChoice outperforms existing MCRC baselines, achieving state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on both the ViMMRC 2.0 benchmark and the newly introduced dataset. Additionally, we show that jointly training option decision and explanation generation leads to significant improvements in multiple-choice accuracy.

### ATTNPO: Attention-Guided Process Supervision for Efficient Reasoning

Large reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards (RLVR) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet often overthink, generating redundant reasoning without performance gains. Existing trajectory-level length penalties often fail to effectively shorten reasoning length and degrade accuracy, as they uniformly treat all reasoning steps and lack fine-grained signals to distinguish redundancy from necessity. Meanwhile, process-supervised methods are typically resource-intensive and suffer from inaccurate credit assignment. To address these issues, we propose ATTNPO, a low-overhead process-supervised RL framework that leverages the model's intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment. We first identify a set of special attention heads that naturally focus on essential steps while suppressing redundant ones. By leveraging the attention scores of these heads, We then employ two sub-strategies to mitigate overthinking by discouraging redundant steps while preserving accuracy by reducing penalties on essential steps. Experimental results show that ATTNPO substantially reduces reasoning length while significantly improving performance across 9 benchmarks.

### LLMs Encode Their Failures: Predicting Success from Pre-Generation Activations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09924v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09924v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09924v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09924v1)

Running LLMs with extended reasoning on every problem is expensive, but determining which inputs actually require additional compute remains challenging. We investigate whether their own likelihood of success is recoverable from their internal representations before generation, and if this signal can guide more efficient inference. We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty. Our code is available at: https://github.com/KabakaWilliam/llms_know_difficulty

### AmharicIR+Instr: A Two-Dataset Resource for Neural Retrieval and Instruction Tuning

Neural retrieval and GPT-style generative models rely on large, high-quality supervised data, which is still scarce for low-resource languages such as Amharic. We release an Amharic data resource consisting of two datasets that supports research on (i) neural retrieval-ranking and (ii) instruction-following text generation. The retrieval-ranking dataset contains 1,091 manually verified query-positive-negative document triplets drawn from diverse Amharic sources and constructed to support contrastive training and benchmarking of neural retrievers (e.g., DPR, ColBERT-style late interaction and SPLADE-style sparse neural retrieval). Triplets are created through a combination of expert-curated queries, web-derived queries, and LLM-assisted generation, with positive/negative documents selected from the web or synthesized by LLMs and then validated by native speakers. The instruction prompt-response dataset comprises 6,285 Amharic prompt-response pairs spanning multiple domains and instruction types, generated with several LLMs and refined through manual review and correction for grammaticality, relevance, fluency, and factual plausibility. We release both datasets with standardized splits and formats (CSV,JSON,JSONL) to enable reproducible work on Amharic retrieval, ranking, and generative modelling. These datasets also come with a methodology that can be generalized to other low-resource languages.

### QP-OneModel: A Unified Generative LLM for Multi-Task Query Understanding in Xiaohongshu Search
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09901v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09901v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09901v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09901v1)

Query Processing (QP) bridges user intent and content supply in large-scale Social Network Service (SNS) search engines. Traditional QP systems rely on pipelines of isolated discriminative models (e.g., BERT), suffering from limited semantic understanding and high maintenance overhead. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential solution, existing approaches often optimize sub-tasks in isolation, neglecting intrinsic semantic synergy and necessitating independent iterations. Moreover, standard generative methods often lack grounding in SNS scenarios, failing to bridge the gap between open-domain corpora and informal SNS linguistic patterns, while struggling to adhere to rigorous business definitions. We present QP-OneModel, a Unified Generative LLM for Multi-Task Query Understanding in the SNS domain. We reformulate heterogeneous sub-tasks into a unified sequence generation paradigm, adopting a progressive three-stage alignment strategy culminating in multi-reward Reinforcement Learning. Furthermore, QP-OneModel generates intent descriptions as a novel high-fidelity semantic signal, effectively augmenting downstream tasks such as query rewriting and ranking. Offline evaluations show QP-OneModel achieves a 7.35% overall gain over discriminative baselines, with significant F1 boosts in NER (+9.01%) and Term Weighting (+9.31%). It also exhibits superior generalization, surpassing a 32B model by 7.60% accuracy on unseen tasks. Fully deployed at Xiaohongshu, online A/B tests confirm its industrial value, optimizing retrieval relevance (DCG) by 0.21% and lifting user retention by 0.044%.

### The Devil Behind Moltbook: Anthropic Safety is Always Vanishing in Self-Evolving AI Societies
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09877v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09877v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09877v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09877v1)

The emergence of multi-agent systems built from large language models (LLMs) offers a promising paradigm for scalable collective intelligence and self-evolution. Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.

### Steer2Edit: From Activation Steering to Component-Level Editing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09870v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09870v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09870v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09870v1)

2026/02/10 15:15 GTM

Steering methods influence Large Language Model behavior by identifying semantic directions in hidden representations, but are typically realized through inference-time activation interventions that apply a fixed, global modification to the model's internal states. While effective, such interventions often induce unfavorable attribute-utility trade-offs under strong control, as they ignore the fact that many behaviors are governed by a small and heterogeneous subset of model components. We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average. Overall, Steer2Edit provides a principled bridge between representation steering and weight editing by translating steering signals into interpretable, training-free parameter updates.

### Code2World: A GUI World Model via Renderable Code Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09856v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09856v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09856v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09856v1)

Autonomous GUI agents interact with environments by perceiving interfaces and executing actions. As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction. However, existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability. To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation. The code is available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/Code2World.

### How Do People Quantify Naturally: Evidence from Mandarin Picture Description

Quantification is a fundamental component of everyday language use, yet little is known about how speakers decide whether and how to quantify in naturalistic production. We investigate quantification in Mandarin Chinese using a picture-based elicited description task in which speakers freely described scenes containing multiple objects, without explicit instructions to count or quantify. Across both spoken and written modalities, we examine three aspects of quantification: whether speakers choose to quantify at all, how precise their quantification is, and which quantificational strategies they adopt. Results show that object numerosity, animacy, and production modality systematically shape quantificational behaviour. In particular, increasing numerosity reduces both the likelihood and the precision of quantification, while animate referents and modality selectively modulate strategy choice. This study demonstrates how quantification can be examined under unconstrained production conditions and provides a naturalistic dataset for further analyses of quantity expression in language production.

### LLM Reasoning Predicts When Models Are Right: Evidence from Coding Classroom Discourse

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to automatically label and analyze educational dialogue at scale, yet current pipelines lack reliable ways to detect when models are wrong. We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis.

### From FusHa to Folk: Exploring Cross-Lingual Transfer in Arabic Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09826v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09826v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09826v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09826v1)

Arabic Language Models (LMs) are pretrained predominately on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and are expected to transfer to its dialects. While MSA as the standard written variety is commonly used in formal settings, people speak and write online in various dialects that are spread across the Arab region. This poses limitations for Arabic LMs, since its dialects vary in their similarity to MSA. In this work we study cross-lingual transfer of Arabic models using probing on 3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks, and representational similarity. Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects. This questions their degree of similarity, and raises concerns for cross-lingual transfer in Arabic models.

### Covo-Audio Technical Report

In this work, we present Covo-Audio, a 7B-parameter end-to-end LALM that directly processes continuous audio inputs and generates audio outputs within a single unified architecture. Through large-scale curated pretraining and targeted post-training, Covo-Audio achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance among models of comparable scale across a broad spectrum of tasks, including speech-text modeling, spoken dialogue, speech understanding, audio understanding, and full-duplex voice interaction. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the pretrained foundation model exhibits strong speech-text comprehension and semantic reasoning capabilities on multiple benchmarks, outperforming representative open-source models of comparable scale. Furthermore, Covo-Audio-Chat, the dialogue-oriented variant, demonstrates strong spoken conversational abilities, including understanding, contextual reasoning, instruction following, and generating contextually appropriate and empathetic responses, validating its applicability to real-world conversational assistant scenarios. Covo-Audio-Chat-FD, the evolved full-duplex model, achieves substantially superior performance on both spoken dialogue capabilities and full-duplex interaction behaviors, demonstrating its competence in practical robustness. To mitigate the high cost of deploying end-to-end LALMs for natural conversational systems, we propose an intelligence-speaker decoupling strategy that separates dialogue intelligence from voice rendering, enabling flexible voice customization with minimal text-to-speech (TTS) data while preserving dialogue performance. Overall, our results highlight the strong potential of 7B-scale models to integrate sophisticated audio intelligence with high-level semantic reasoning, and suggest a scalable path toward more capable and versatile LALMs.

### Text summarization via global structure awareness
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09821v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09821v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09821v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09821v1)

Text summarization is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), and the information explosion has made long-document processing increasingly demanding, making summarization essential. Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains.

### AnalyticsGPT: An LLM Workflow for Scientometric Question Answering

This paper introduces AnalyticsGPT, an intuitive and efficient large language model (LLM)-powered workflow for scientometric question answering. This underrepresented downstream task addresses the subcategory of meta-scientific questions concerning the "science of science." When compared to traditional scientific question answering based on papers, the task poses unique challenges in the planning phase. Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses. As a database for retrieval-augmented generation, we leverage a proprietary research performance assessment platform. For evaluation, we consult experienced subject matter experts and leverage LLMs-as-judges. In doing so, we provide valuable insights on the efficacy of LLMs towards a niche downstream task.

### Decomposing Reasoning Efficiency in Large Language Models

Large language models trained for reasoning trade off inference tokens against accuracy, yet standard evaluations report only final accuracy, obscuring where tokens are spent or wasted. We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions.

### Would a Large Language Model Pay Extra for a View? Inferring Willingness to Pay from Subjective Choices
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09802v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09802v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09802v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09802v1)

2026/02/10 14:05 GTM

As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications such as travel assistance and purchasing support, they are often required to make subjective choices on behalf of users in settings where no objectively correct answer exists. We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice.

### Where Are We At with Automatic Speech Recognition for the Bambara Language?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09785v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09785v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09785v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09785v1)

This paper introduces the first standardized benchmark for evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in the Bambara language, utilizing one hour of professionally recorded Malian constitutional text. Designed as a controlled reference set under near-optimal acoustic and linguistic conditions, the benchmark was used to evaluate 37 models, ranging from Bambara-trained systems to large-scale commercial models. Our findings reveal that current ASR performance remains significantly below deployment standards in a narrow formal domain; the top-performing system in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) achieved 46.76\% and the best Character Error Rate (CER) of 13.00\% was set by another model, while several prominent multilingual models exceeded 100\% WER. These results suggest that multilingual pre-training and model scaling alone are insufficient for underrepresented languages. Furthermore, because this dataset represents a best-case scenario of the most simplified and formal form of spoken Bambara, these figures are yet to be tested against practical, real-world settings. We provide the benchmark and an accompanying public leaderboard to facilitate transparent evaluation and future research in Bambara speech technology.

### Circuit Fingerprints: How Answer Tokens Encode Their Geometrical Path
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09784v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09784v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09784v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09784v1)

Circuit discovery and activation steering in transformers have developed as separate research threads, yet both operate on the same representational space. Are they two views of the same underlying structure? We show they follow a single geometric principle: answer tokens, processed in isolation, encode the directions that would produce them. This Circuit Fingerprint hypothesis enables circuit discovery without gradients or causal intervention -- recovering comparable structure to gradient-based methods through geometric alignment alone. We validate this on standard benchmarks (IOI, SVA, MCQA) across four model families, achieving circuit discovery performance comparable to gradient-based methods. The same directions that identify circuit components also enable controlled steering -- achieving 69.8\% emotion classification accuracy versus 53.1\% for instruction prompting while preserving factual accuracy. Beyond method development, this read-write duality reveals that transformer circuits are fundamentally geometric structures: interpretability and controllability are two facets of the same object.

### Why Linear Interpretability Works: Invariant Subspaces as a Result of Architectural Constraints
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09783v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09783v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09783v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09783v1)

2026/02/10 13:42 GTM

Linear probes and sparse autoencoders consistently recover meaningful structure from transformer representations -- yet why should such simple methods succeed in deep, nonlinear systems? We show this is not merely an empirical regularity but a consequence of architectural necessity: transformers communicate information through linear interfaces (attention OV circuits, unembedding matrices), and any semantic feature decoded through such an interface must occupy a context-invariant linear subspace. We formalize this as the \emph{Invariant Subspace Necessity} theorem and derive the \emph{Self-Reference Property}: tokens directly provide the geometric direction for their associated features, enabling zero-shot identification of semantic structure without labeled data or learned probes. Empirical validation in eight classification tasks and four model families confirms the alignment between class tokens and semantically related instances. Our framework provides \textbf{a principled architectural explanation} for why linear interpretability methods work, unifying linear probes and sparse autoencoders.

### Flexible Entropy Control in RLVR with Gradient-Preserving Perspective

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a critical method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies effectively mitigate entropy collapse, and achieve superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

### Improving Interpretability of Lexical Semantic Change with Neurobiological Features
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09760v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09760v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09760v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09760v1)

Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) is the phenomenon in which the meaning of a word change over time. Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out. The results demonstrate that our method not only discovers interesting types of LSC that have been overlooked in previous studies but also effectively searches for words with specific types of LSC.

### Targum -- A Multilingual New Testament Translation Corpus

Many European languages possess rich biblical translation histories, yet existing corpora - in prioritizing linguistic breadth - often fail to capture this depth. To address this gap, we introduce a multilingual corpus of 657 New Testament translations, of which 352 are unique, with unprecedented depth in five languages: English (208 unique versions from 396 total), French (41 from 78), Italian (18 from 33), Polish (30 from 48), and Spanish (55 from 102). Aggregated from 12 online biblical libraries and one preexisting corpus, each translation is manually annotated with metadata that maps the text to a standardized identifier for the work, its specific edition, and its year of revision. This canonicalization empowers researchers to define "uniqueness" for their own needs: they can perform micro-level analyses on translation families, such as the KJV lineage, or conduct macro-level studies by deduplicating closely related texts. By providing the first resource designed for such flexible, multilevel analysis, our corpus establishes a new benchmark for the quantitative study of translation history.

### AI-Assisted Scientific Assessment: A Case Study on Climate Change

The emerging paradigm of AI co-scientists focuses on tasks characterized by repeatable verification, where agents explore search spaces in 'guess and check' loops. This paradigm does not extend to problems where repeated evaluation is impossible and ground truth is established by the consensus synthesis of theory and existing evidence. We evaluate a Gemini-based AI environment designed to support collaborative scientific assessment, integrated into a standard scientific workflow. In collaboration with a diverse group of 13 scientists working in the field of climate science, we tested the system on a complex topic: the stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our results show that AI can accelerate the scientific workflow. The group produced a comprehensive synthesis of 79 papers through 104 revision cycles in just over 46 person-hours. AI contribution was significant: most AI-generated content was retained in the report. AI also helped maintain logical consistency and presentation quality. However, expert additions were crucial to ensure its acceptability: less than half of the report was produced by AI. Furthermore, substantial oversight was required to expand and elevate the content to rigorous scientific standards.

### Unsupervised Layer-Wise Dynamic Test Time Adaptation for LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09719v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09719v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09719v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09719v1)

2026/02/10 12:22 GTM

Test-time adaptation (TTA) for large language models (LLMs) updates model parameters at inference time using signals available at deployment. This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control. Experiments across various datasets and LLMs consistently show that our method substantially strengthens TTA by learning effective scaling patterns over adaptation steps and transformer layer projections, improving stability while delivering better performance.

### TraceMem: Weaving Narrative Memory Schemata from User Conversational Traces
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09712v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09712v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09712v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09712v1)

2026/02/10 12:14 GTM

Sustaining long-term interactions remains a bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), as their limited context windows struggle to manage dialogue histories that extend over time. Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture. Analysis shows that by constructing coherent narratives, it surpasses baselines in multi-hop and temporal reasoning, underscoring its essential role in deep narrative comprehension. Additionally, we provide an open discussion on memory systems, offering our perspectives and future outlook on the field. Our code implementation is available at: https://github.com/YimingShu-teay/TraceMem

### Maastricht University at AMIYA: Adapting LLMs for Dialectal Arabic using Fine-tuning and MBR Decoding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09703v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09703v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09703v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09703v1)

2026/02/10 12:02 GTM

Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly multilingual, supporting hundreds of languages, especially high resource ones. Unfortunately, Dialect variations are still underrepresented due to limited data and linguistic variation. In this work, we adapt a pre-trained LLM to improve dialectal performance. Specifically, we use Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on monolingual and English Dialect parallel data, adapter merging and dialect-aware MBR decoding to improve dialectal fidelity generation and translation. Experiments on Syrian, Moroccan, and Saudi Arabic show that merging and MBR improve dialectal fidelity while preserving semantic accuracy. This combination provides a compact and effective framework for robust dialectal Arabic generation.

### Life Cycle-Aware Evaluation of Knowledge Distillation for Machine Translation: Environmental Impact and Translation Quality Trade-offs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09691v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09691v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09691v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09691v1)

Knowledge distillation (KD) is a tool to compress a larger system (teacher) into a smaller one (student). In machine translation, studies typically report only the translation quality of the student and omit the computational complexity of performing KD, making it difficult to select among the many available KD choices under compute-induced constraints. In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation. Our protocol provides reproducible guidance for selecting KD methods under explicit quality and compute-induced constraints.

### MATA: Multi-Agent Framework for Reliable and Flexible Table Question Answering

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved table understanding tasks such as Table Question Answering (TableQA), yet challenges remain in ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency, especially in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments. In this paper, we introduce MATA, a multi-agent TableQA framework that leverages multiple complementary reasoning paths and a set of tools built with small language models. MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference. Our results highlight that careful orchestration of multiple reasoning pathways yields scalable and reliable TableQA. The code is available at https://github.com/AIDAS-Lab/MATA.

### MILE-RefHumEval: A Reference-Free, Multi-Independent LLM Framework for Human-Aligned Evaluation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09624v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09624v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09624v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09624v1)

2026/02/10 10:10 GTM

We introduce MILE-RefHumEval, a reference-free framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) without ground-truth annotations or evaluator coordination. It leverages an ensemble of independently prompted evaluators guided by a human-aligned schema, supporting both discrete and continuous scoring judgement. With task-specific prompts from best candidate selection, summarization and image captioning to dialogue, MILE-RefHumEval provides flexible, interpretable, and scalable assessments. Experiments show it aligns closely with human judgments, outperforms prior methods, and reduces computational overhead, offering an efficient, robust, and human-aligned solution for real-world LLM evaluation.

### AlignTune: Modular Toolkit for Post-Training Alignment of Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09621v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09621v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09621v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09621v1)

2026/02/10 10:08 GTM

Post-training alignment is central to deploying large language models (LLMs), yet practical workflows remain split across backend-specific tools and ad-hoc glue code, making experiments hard to reproduce. We identify backend interference, reward fragmentation, and irreproducible pipelines as key obstacles in alignment research. We introduce AlignTune, a modular toolkit exposing a unified interface for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RLHF-style optimization with interchangeable TRL and Unsloth backends. AlignTune standardizes configuration, provides an extensible reward layer (rule-based and learned), and integrates evaluation over standard benchmarks and custom tasks. By isolating backend-specific logic behind a single factory boundary, AlignTune enables controlled comparisons and reproducible alignment experiments.

### Learning from the Irrecoverable: Error-Localized Policy Optimization for Tool-Integrated LLM Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09598v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09598v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09598v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09598v1)

2026/02/10 09:50 GTM

Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) enables LLM agents to solve tasks through planning, tool use, and iterative revision, but outcome-only reinforcement learning in this setting suffers from sparse, delayed rewards and weak step-level credit assignment. In long-horizon TIR trajectories, an early irrecoverable mistake can determine success or failure, making it crucial to localize the first irrecoverable step and leverage it for fine-grained credit assignment. We propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), which localizes the first irrecoverable step via binary-search rollout trees under a fixed rollout budget, converts the resulting tree into stable learning signals through hierarchical advantage attribution, and applies error-localized adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on the critical step and its suffix. Across TIR benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, ELPO consistently outperforms strong Agentic RL baselines under comparable sampling budgets, with additional gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency.

Reinforcement learning substantially improves reasoning in large language models, but it also tends to lengthen chain of thought outputs and increase computational cost during both training and inference. Though length control methods have been proposed, it remains unclear what the optimal output length is for balancing efficiency and performance. In this work, we compare several length control methods on two models, Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our results indicate that length penalties may hinder reasoning acquisition, while properly tuned length control can improve efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. By extending prior work to RL trained policies, we identify two failure modes, 1) long outputs increase dispersion, and 2) short outputs lead to under-thinking.

### Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Gender Bias Mitigation in Language Models

A challenge in mitigating social bias in fine-tuned language models (LMs) is the potential reduction in language modeling capability, which can harm downstream performance. Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality. Experimental results on gender bias benchmarks demonstrate that Context-CDA effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing language modeling performance while offering insights into social biases by analyzing distribution shifts in next-token generation probabilities.

### Aligning Tree-Search Policies with Fixed Token Budgets in Test-Time Scaling of LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09574v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09574v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09574v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09574v1)

Tree-search decoding is an effective form of test-time scaling for large language models (LLMs), but real-world deployment imposes a fixed per-query token budget that varies across settings. Existing tree-search policies are largely budget-agnostic, treating the budget as a termination condition, which can lead to late-stage over-branching or premature termination. We propose {Budget-Guided MCTS} (BG-MCTS), a tree-search decoding algorithm that aligns its search policy with the remaining token budget: it starts with broad exploration, then prioritizes refinement and answer completion as the budget depletes while reducing late-stage branching from shallow nodes. BG-MCTS consistently outperforms budget-agnostic tree-search baselines across different budgets on MATH500 and AIME24/25 with open-weight LLMs.

### LEMUR: A Corpus for Robust Fine-Tuning of Multilingual Law Embedding Models for Retrieval

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to access legal information. Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues. We publish code\footnote{\href{https://github.com/nargesbh/eur_lex}{GitHub Repository}} and data\footnote{\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/G4KMU/LEMUR}{Hugging Face Dataset}}.

### Advancing Block Diffusion Language Models for Test-Time Scaling

Recent advances in block diffusion language models have demonstrated competitive performance and strong scalability on reasoning tasks. However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24). These results mark an important step toward unlocking the potential of BDLMs for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks.

### Comprehensive Comparison of RAG Methods Across Multi-Domain Conversational QA

Conversational question answering increasingly relies on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure. We publish the code used.\footnote{\href{https://github.com/Klejda-A/exp-rag.git}{GitHub Repository}}

### UniARM: Towards a Unified Autoregressive Reward Model for Multi-Objective Test-Time Alignment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09538v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09538v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09538v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09538v1)

Multi-objective alignment aims to align LLM responses with multiple human preference objectives. Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment. UniARM jointly models all preference dimensions in a single parameter space, eliminating the need for independent parameters for each preference objective. es on larger-scale LLMs, enhancing its practical usability.

### Knowledge Integration Decay in Search-Augmented Reasoning of Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09517v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09517v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09517v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09517v1)

2026/02/10 08:20 GTM

Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks by employing search-augmented reasoning to incorporate external knowledge into long chains of thought. However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs.

The CheckThat! lab aims to advance the development of innovative technologies combating disinformation and manipulation efforts in online communication across a multitude of languages and platforms. While in early editions the focus has been on core tasks of the verification pipeline (check-worthiness, evidence retrieval, and verification), in the past three editions, the lab added additional tasks linked to the verification process. In this year's edition, the verification pipeline is at the center again with the following tasks: Task 1 on source retrieval for scientific web claims (a follow-up of the 2025 edition), Task 2 on fact-checking numerical and temporal claims, which adds a reasoning component to the 2025 edition, and Task 3, which expands the verification pipeline with generation of full-fact-checking articles. These tasks represent challenging classification and retrieval problems as well as generation challenges at the document and span level, including multilingual settings.

### EcoGym: Evaluating LLMs for Long-Horizon Plan-and-Execute in Interactive Economies
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09514v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09514v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09514v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09514v1)

Long-horizon planning is widely recognized as a core capability of autonomous LLM-based agents; however, current evaluation frameworks suffer from being largely episodic, domain-specific, or insufficiently grounded in persistent economic dynamics. We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.

### Where-to-Unmask: Ground-Truth-Guided Unmasking Order Learning for Masked Diffusion Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09501v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09501v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09501v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09501v1)

Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) generate text by iteratively filling masked tokens, requiring two coupled decisions at each step: which positions to unmask (where-to-unmask) and which tokens to place (what-to-unmask). While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts. The resulting planner integrates into standard MDLM sampling to select where-to-unmask, improving reasoning accuracy without modifying the token prediction model.

### Listen to the Layers: Mitigating Hallucinations with Inter-Layer Disagreement

Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent yet factually incorrect text-a phenomenon known as hallucinations, undermining their reliability and utility in downstream tasks. We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral). By leveraging model-intrinsic signals, CoCoA offers an effective and broadly applicable method for enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs at inference time, without requiring any model retraining.

Extracting drug use information from unstructured Electronic Health Records remains a major challenge in clinical Natural Language Processing. While Large Language Models demonstrate advancements, their use in clinical NLP is limited by concerns over trust, control, and efficiency. To address this, we present NOWJ submission to the ToxHabits Shared Task at BioCreative IX. This task targets the detection of toxic substance use and contextual attributes in Spanish clinical texts, a domain-specific, low-resource setting. We propose a multi-output ensemble system tackling both Subtask 1 - ToxNER and Subtask 2 - ToxUse. Our system integrates BETO with a CRF layer for sequence labeling, employs diverse training strategies, and uses sentence filtering to boost precision. Our top run achieved 0.94 F1 and 0.97 precision for Trigger Detection, and 0.91 F1 for Argument Detection.

Vericoding refers to the generation of formally verified code from rigorous specifications. Recent AI models show promise in vericoding, but a unified methodology for cross-paradigm evaluation is lacking. Existing benchmarks test only individual languages/tools (e.g., Dafny, Verus, and Lean) and each covers very different tasks, so the performance numbers are not directly comparable. We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers. All data and evaluation code can be found at https://github.com/haoyuzhao123/algoveri.

### SWE-AGI: Benchmarking Specification-Driven Software Construction with MoonBit in the Era of Autonomous Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09447v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09447v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09447v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09447v1)

2026/02/10 06:31 GTM

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive coding capabilities, their ability to autonomously build production-scale software from explicit specifications remains an open question. We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems. Behavioral analysis further reveals that as codebases scale, code reading, rather than writing, becomes the dominant bottleneck in AI-assisted development. Overall, while specification-driven autonomous software engineering is increasingly viable, substantial challenges remain before it can reliably support production-scale development.

### Conceptual Cultural Index: A Metric for Cultural Specificity via Relative Generality
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09444v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09444v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09444v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09444v1)

2026/02/10 06:29 GTM

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multicultural settings; however, systematic evaluation of cultural specificity at the sentence level remains underexplored. We propose the Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI), which estimates cultural specificity at the sentence level. CCI is defined as the difference between the generality estimate within the target culture and the average generality estimate across other cultures. This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones. For binary separability, CCI outperforms direct LLM scoring, yielding more than a 10-point improvement in AUC for models specialized to the target culture. Our code is available at https://github.com/IyatomiLab/CCI .

### Evaluating Social Bias in RAG Systems: When External Context Helps and Reasoning Hurts
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09442v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09442v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09442v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09442v1)

Social biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) raise significant fairness concerns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off.

### Breaking the Pre-Sampling Barrier: Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09438v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09438v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09438v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09438v1)

2026/02/10 06:05 GTM

Self-Consistency (SC) is an effective decoding strategy that improves the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating multiple chain-of-thought reasoning paths and selecting the final answer via majority voting. However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks. Experimental results show that ACTSC effectively reduces inference costs while maintaining accuracy relative to existing methods.

### SAGE: Scalable Agentic 3D Scene Generation for Embodied AI

Real-world data collection for embodied agents remains costly and unsafe, calling for scalable, realistic, and simulator-ready 3D environments. However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., "pick up a bowl and place it on the table"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI. Code, demos, and the SAGE-10k dataset can be found on the project page here: https://nvlabs.github.io/sage.

Recent advances in sampling-based motion planning algorithms for high DOF arms leverage GPUs to provide SOTA performance. These algorithms can be used to control multiple arms jointly, but this approach scales poorly. To address this, we extend STORM, a sampling-based model-predictive-control (MPC) motion planning algorithm, to handle multiple robots in a distributed fashion. First, we modify STORM to handle dynamic obstacles. Then, we let each arm compute its own motion plan prefix, which it shares with the other arms, which treat it as a dynamic obstacle. Finally, we add a dynamic priority scheme. The new algorithm, MR-STORM, demonstrates clear empirical advantages over SOTA algorithms when operating with both static and dynamic obstacles.

### Learning Agile Quadrotor Flight in the Real World

Learning-based controllers have achieved impressive performance in agile quadrotor flight but typically rely on massive training in simulation, necessitating accurate system identification for effective Sim2Real transfer. However, even with precise modeling, fixed policies remain susceptible to out-of-distribution scenarios, ranging from external aerodynamic disturbances to internal hardware degradation. To ensure safety under these evolving uncertainties, such controllers are forced to operate with conservative safety margins, inherently constraining their agility outside of controlled settings. While online adaptation offers a potential remedy, safely exploring physical limits remains a critical bottleneck due to data scarcity and safety risks. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-adaptive framework that eliminates the need for precise system identification or offline Sim2Real transfer. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Scaling (ATS) to actively explore platform physical limits, and employ online residual learning to augment a simple nominal model. {Based on the learned hybrid model, we further propose Real-world Anchored Short-horizon Backpropagation Through Time (RASH-BPTT) to achieve efficient and robust in-flight policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our quadrotor reliably executes agile maneuvers near actuator saturation limits. The system evolves a conservative base policy with a peak speed of 1.9 m/s to 7.3 m/s within approximately 100 seconds of flight time. These findings underscore that real-world adaptation serves not merely to compensate for modeling errors, but as a practical mechanism for sustained performance improvement in aggressive flight regimes.

Large vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but fall short when extended to embodied tasks, where instructions must be transformed into low-level motor actions. We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -> 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -> 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings. These results highlight scalable spatially guided training as a promising direction for robust, generalizable robot learning.

### EgoHumanoid: Unlocking In-the-Wild Loco-Manipulation with Robot-Free Egocentric Demonstration

Human demonstrations offer rich environmental diversity and scale naturally, making them an appealing alternative to robot teleoperation. While this paradigm has advanced robot-arm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, data-hungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EgoHumanoid, the first framework to co-train a vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with a limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce a systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\%, particularly in unseen environments. Our analysis further reveals which behaviors transfer effectively and the potential for scaling human data.

### DexImit: Learning Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation from Monocular Human Videos
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10105v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10105v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10105v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10105v1)

Data scarcity fundamentally limits the generalization of bimanual dexterous manipulation, as real-world data collection for dexterous hands is expensive and labor-intensive. Human manipulation videos, as a direct carrier of manipulation knowledge, offer significant potential for scaling up robot learning. However, the substantial embodiment gap between human hands and robotic dexterous hands makes direct pretraining from human videos extremely challenging. To bridge this gap and unleash the potential of large-scale human manipulation video data, we propose DexImit, an automated framework that converts monocular human manipulation videos into physically plausible robot data, without any additional information. DexImit employs a four-stage generation pipeline: (1) reconstructing hand-object interactions from arbitrary viewpoints with near-metric scale; (2) performing subtask decomposition and bimanual scheduling; (3) synthesizing robot trajectories consistent with the demonstrated interactions; (4) comprehensive data augmentation for zero-shot real-world deployment. Building on these designs, DexImit can generate large-scale robot data based on human videos, either from the Internet or video generation models. DexImit is capable of handling diverse manipulation tasks, including tool use (e.g., cutting an apple), long-horizon tasks (e.g., making a beverage), and fine-grained manipulations (e.g., stacking cups).

### Robo3R: Enhancing Robotic Manipulation with Accurate Feed-Forward 3D Reconstruction

3D spatial perception is fundamental to generalizable robotic manipulation, yet obtaining reliable, high-quality 3D geometry remains challenging. Depth sensors suffer from noise and material sensitivity, while existing reconstruction models lack the precision and metric consistency required for physical interaction. We introduce Robo3R, a feed-forward, manipulation-ready 3D reconstruction model that predicts accurate, metric-scale scene geometry directly from RGB images and robot states in real time. Robo3R jointly infers scale-invariant local geometry and relative camera poses, which are unified into the scene representation in the canonical robot frame via a learned global similarity transformation. To meet the precision demands of manipulation, Robo3R employs a masked point head for sharp, fine-grained point clouds, and a keypoint-based Perspective-n-Point (PnP) formulation to refine camera extrinsics and global alignment. Trained on Robo3R-4M, a curated large-scale synthetic dataset with four million high-fidelity annotated frames, Robo3R consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction methods and depth sensors. Across downstream tasks including imitation learning, sim-to-real transfer, grasp synthesis, and collision-free motion planning, we observe consistent gains in performance, suggesting the promise of this alternative 3D sensing module for robotic manipulation.

### VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10098v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10098v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10098v1)

2026/02/10 18:58 GTM

Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is \emph{leakage-free state prediction}: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.

### UniVTAC: A Unified Simulation Platform for Visuo-Tactile Manipulation Data Generation, Learning, and Benchmarking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10093v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10093v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10093v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10093v1)

2026/02/10 18:57 GTM

Robotic manipulation has seen rapid progress with vision-language-action (VLA) policies. However, visuo-tactile perception is critical for contact-rich manipulation, as tasks such as insertion are difficult to complete robustly using vision alone. At the same time, acquiring large-scale and reliable tactile data in the physical world remains costly and challenging, and the lack of a unified evaluation platform further limits policy learning and systematic analysis. To address these challenges, we propose UniVTAC, a simulation-based visuo-tactile data synthesis platform that supports three commonly used visuo-tactile sensors and enables scalable and controllable generation of informative contact interactions. Based on this platform, we introduce the UniVTAC Encoder, a visuo-tactile encoder trained on large-scale simulation-synthesized data with designed supervisory signals, providing tactile-centric visuo-tactile representations for downstream manipulation tasks. In addition, we present the UniVTAC Benchmark, which consists of eight representative visuo-tactile manipulation tasks for evaluating tactile-driven policies. Experimental results show that integrating the UniVTAC Encoder improves average success rates by 17.1% on the UniVTAC Benchmark, while real-world robotic experiments further demonstrate a 25% improvement in task success.

### Humanoid Factors: Design Principles for AI Humanoids in Human Worlds

Human factors research has long focused on optimizing environments, tools, and systems to account for human performance. Yet, as humanoid robots begin to share our workplaces, homes, and public spaces, the design challenge expands. We must now consider not only factors for humans but also factors for humanoids, since both will coexist and interact within the same environments. Unlike conventional machines, humanoids introduce expectations of human-like behavior, communication, and social presence, which reshape usability, trust, and safety considerations. In this article, we introduce the concept of humanoid factors as a framework structured around four pillars - physical, cognitive, social, and ethical - that shape the development of humanoids to help them effectively coexist and collaborate with humans. This framework characterizes the overlap and divergence between human capabilities and those of general-purpose humanoids powered by AI foundation models. To demonstrate our framework's practical utility, we then apply the framework to evaluate a real-world humanoid control algorithm, illustrating how conventional task completion metrics in robotics overlook key human cognitive and interaction principles. We thus position humanoid factors as a foundational framework for designing, evaluating, and governing sustained human-humanoid coexistence.

### A Collision-Free Sway Damping Model Predictive Controller for Safe and Reactive Forestry Crane Navigation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10035v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10035v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10035v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10035v1)

2026/02/10 17:58 GTM

Forestry cranes operate in dynamic, unstructured outdoor environments where simultaneous collision avoidance and payload sway control are critical for safe navigation. Existing approaches address these challenges separately, either focusing on sway damping with predefined collision-free paths or performing collision avoidance only at the global planning level. We present the first collision-free, sway-damping model predictive controller (MPC) for a forestry crane that unifies both objectives in a single control framework. Our approach integrates LiDAR-based environment mapping directly into the MPC using online Euclidean distance fields (EDF), enabling real-time environmental adaptation. The controller simultaneously enforces collision constraints while damping payload sway, allowing it to (i) replan upon quasi-static environmental changes, (ii) maintain collision-free operation under disturbances, and (iii) provide safe stopping when no bypass exists. Experimental validation on a real forestry crane demonstrates effective sway damping and successful obstacle avoidance. A video can be found at https://youtu.be/tEXDoeLLTxA.

### Perception with Guarantees: Certified Pose Estimation via Reachability Analysis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10032v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10032v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10032v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10032v1)

2026/02/10 17:55 GTM

Agents in cyber-physical systems are increasingly entrusted with safety-critical tasks. Ensuring safety of these agents often requires localizing the pose for subsequent actions. Pose estimates can, e.g., be obtained from various combinations of lidar sensors, cameras, and external services such as GPS. Crucially, in safety-critical domains, a rough estimate is insufficient to formally determine safety, i.e., guaranteeing safety even in the worst-case scenario, and external services might additionally not be trustworthy. We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach efficiently and accurately localizes agents in both synthetic and real-world experiments.

### RoboSubtaskNet: Temporal Sub-task Segmentation for Human-to-Robot Skill Transfer in Real-World Environments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10015v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10015v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10015v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10015v1)

2026/02/10 17:37 GTM

Temporally locating and classifying fine-grained sub-task segments in long, untrimmed videos is crucial to safe human-robot collaboration. Unlike generic activity recognition, collaborative manipulation requires sub-task labels that are directly robot-executable. We present RoboSubtaskNet, a multi-stage human-to-robot sub-task segmentation framework that couples attention-enhanced I3D features (RGB plus optical flow) with a modified MS-TCN employing a Fibonacci dilation schedule to capture better short-horizon transitions such as reach-pick-place. The network is trained with a composite objective comprising cross-entropy and temporal regularizers (truncated MSE and a transition-aware term) to reduce over-segmentation and to encourage valid sub-task progressions. To close the gap between vision benchmarks and control, we introduce RoboSubtask, a dataset of healthcare and industrial demonstrations annotated at the sub-task level and designed for deterministic mapping to manipulator primitives. Empirically, RoboSubtaskNet outperforms MS-TCN and MS-TCN++ on GTEA and our RoboSubtask benchmark (boundary-sensitive and sequence metrics), while remaining competitive on the long-horizon Breakfast benchmark. Specifically, RoboSubtaskNet attains F1 @ 50 = 79.5%, Edit = 88.6%, Acc = 78.9% on GTEA; F1 @ 50 = 30.4%, Edit = 52.0%, Acc = 53.5% on Breakfast; and F1 @ 50 = 94.2%, Edit = 95.6%, Acc = 92.2% on RoboSubtask. We further validate the full perception-to-execution pipeline on a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator, achieving reliable end-to-end behavior in physical trials (overall task success approx 91.25%). These results demonstrate a practical path from sub-task level video understanding to deployed robotic manipulation in real-world settings.

### Learning Force-Regulated Manipulation with a Low-Cost Tactile-Force-Controlled Gripper
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10013v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.10013v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10013v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.10013v1)

Successfully manipulating many everyday objects, such as potato chips, requires precise force regulation. Failure to modulate force can lead to task failure or irreversible damage to the objects. Humans can precisely achieve this by adapting force from tactile feedback, even within a short period of physical contact. We aim to give robots this capability. However, commercial grippers exhibit high cost or high minimum force, making them unsuitable for studying force-controlled policy learning with everyday force-sensitive objects. We introduce TF-Gripper, a low-cost (~$150) force-controlled parallel-jaw gripper that integrates tactile sensing as feedback. It has an effective force range of 0.45-45N and is compatible with different robot arms. Additionally, we designed a teleoperation device paired with TF-Gripper to record human-applied grasping forces. While standard low-frequency policies can be trained on this data, they struggle with the reactive, contact-dependent nature of force regulation. To overcome this, we propose RETAF (REactive Tactile Adaptation of Force), a framework that decouples grasping force control from arm pose prediction. RETAF regulates force at high frequency using wrist images and tactile feedback, while a base policy predicts end-effector pose and gripper open/close action. We evaluate TF-Gripper and RETAF across five real-world tasks requiring precise force regulation. Results show that compared to position control, direct force control significantly improves grasp stability and task performance. We further show that tactile feedback is essential for force regulation, and that RETAF consistently outperforms baselines and can be integrated with various base policies. We hope this work opens a path for scaling the learning of force-controlled policies in robotic manipulation. Project page: https://force-gripper.github.io .

### A Collaborative Safety Shield for Safe and Efficient CAV Lane Changes in Congested On-Ramp Merging

Lane changing in dense traffic is a significant challenge for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Existing lane change controllers primarily either ensure safety or collaboratively improve traffic efficiency, but do not consider these conflicting objectives together. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), designed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable safe and collaborative lane changes. The MASS enables collaboration by capturing multi-agent interactions among CAVs through interaction topologies constructed as a graph using a simple algorithm. Further, a state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lane change controller is extended by integrating MASS to ensure safety and defining a customised reward function to prioritise efficiency improvements. As a result, we propose a lane change controller, known as MARL-MASS, and evaluate it in a congested on-ramp merging simulation. The results demonstrate that MASS enables collaborative lane changes with safety guarantees by strictly respecting the safety constraints. Moreover, the proposed custom reward function improves the stability of MARL policies trained with a safety shield. Overall, by encouraging the exploration of a collaborative lane change policy while respecting safety constraints, MARL-MASS effectively balances the trade-off between ensuring safety and improving traffic efficiency in congested traffic. The code for MARL-MASS is available with an open-source licence at https://github.com/hkbharath/MARL-MASS

In recent years, the illicit use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for deliveries in restricted area such as prisons became a significant security challenge. While numerous studies have focused on UAV detection or localization, little attention has been given to delivery events identification. This study presents the first acoustic package delivery detection algorithm using a ground-based microphone array. The proposed method estimates both the drone's propeller speed and the delivery event using solely acoustic features. A deep neural network detects the presence of a drone and estimates the propeller's rotation speed or blade passing frequency (BPF) from a mel spectrogram. The algorithm analyzes the BPFs to identify probable delivery moments based on sudden changes before and after a specific time. Results demonstrate a mean absolute error of the blade passing frequency estimator of 16 Hz when the drone is less than 150 meters away from the microphone array. The drone presence detection estimator has a accuracy of 97%. The delivery detection algorithm correctly identifies 96% of events with a false positive rate of 8%. This study shows that deliveries can be identified using acoustic signals up to a range of 100 meters.

### RoboInter: A Holistic Intermediate Representation Suite Towards Robotic Manipulation

Advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have stimulated growing interest in vision-language-action (VLA) systems for robot manipulation. However, existing manipulation datasets remain costly to curate, highly embodiment-specific, and insufficient in coverage and diversity, thereby hindering the generalization of VLA models. Recent approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations via a plan-then-execute paradigm, where high-level plans (e.g., subtasks, trace) are first generated and subsequently translated into low-level actions, but they critically rely on extra intermediate supervision, which is largely absent from existing datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RoboInter Manipulation Suite, a unified resource including data, benchmarks, and models of intermediate representations for manipulation. It comprises RoboInter-Tool, a lightweight GUI that enables semi-automatic annotation of diverse representations, and RoboInter-Data, a large-scale dataset containing over 230k episodes across 571 diverse scenes, which provides dense per-frame annotations over more than 10 categories of intermediate representations, substantially exceeding prior work in scale and annotation quality. Building upon this foundation, RoboInter-VQA introduces 9 spatial and 20 temporal embodied VQA categories to systematically benchmark and enhance the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Meanwhile, RoboInter-VLA offers an integrated plan-then-execute framework, supporting modular and end-to-end VLA variants that bridge high-level planning with low-level execution via intermediate supervision. In total, RoboInter establishes a practical foundation for advancing robust and generalizable robotic learning via fine-grained and diverse intermediate representations.

### Hydra-Nav: Object Navigation via Adaptive Dual-Process Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09972v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09972v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09972v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09972v1)

While large vision-language models (VLMs) show promise for object goal navigation, current methods still struggle with low success rates and inefficient localization of unseen objects--failures primarily attributed to weak temporal-spatial reasoning. Meanwhile, recent attempts to inject reasoning into VLM-based agents improve success rates but incur substantial computational overhead. To address both the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing approaches, we introduce Hydra-Nav, a unified VLM architecture that adaptively switches between a deliberative slow system for analyzing exploration history and formulating high-level plans, and a reactive fast system for efficient execution. We train Hydra-Nav through a three-stage curriculum: (i) spatial-action alignment to strengthen trajectory planning, (ii) memory-reasoning integration to enhance temporal-spatial reasoning over long-horizon exploration, and (iii) iterative rejection fine-tuning to enable selective reasoning at critical decision points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hydra-Nav achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HM3D, MP3D, and OVON benchmarks, outperforming the second-best methods by 11.1%, 17.4%, and 21.2%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce SOT (Success weighted by Operation Time), a new metric to measure search efficiency across VLMs with varying reasoning intensity. Results show that adaptive reasoning significantly enhances search efficiency over fixed-frequency baselines.

### Instruct2Act: From Human Instruction to Actions Sequencing and Execution via Robot Action Network for Robotic Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09940v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09940v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09940v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09940v1)

Robots often struggle to follow free-form human instructions in real-world settings due to computational and sensing limitations. We address this gap with a lightweight, fully on-device pipeline that converts natural-language commands into reliable manipulation. Our approach has two stages: (i) the instruction to actions module (Instruct2Act), a compact BiLSTM with a multi-head-attention autoencoder that parses an instruction into an ordered sequence of atomic actions (e.g., reach, grasp, move, place); and (ii) the robot action network (RAN), which uses the dynamic adaptive trajectory radial network (DATRN) together with a vision-based environment analyzer (YOLOv8) to generate precise control trajectories for each sub-action. The entire system runs on a modest system with no cloud services. On our custom proprietary dataset, Instruct2Act attains 91.5% sub-actions prediction accuracy while retaining a small footprint. Real-robot evaluations across four tasks (pick-place, pick-pour, wipe, and pick-give) yield an overall 90% success; sub-action inference completes in < 3.8s, with end-to-end executions in 30-60s depending on task complexity. These results demonstrate that fine-grained instruction-to-action parsing, coupled with DATRN-based trajectory generation and vision-guided grounding, provides a practical path to deterministic, real-time manipulation in resource-constrained, single-camera settings.

### TaCo: A Benchmark for Lossless and Lossy Codecs of Heterogeneous Tactile Data
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09893v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09893v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09893v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09893v1)

Tactile sensing is crucial for embodied intelligence, providing fine-grained perception and control in complex environments. However, efficient tactile data compression, which is essential for real-time robotic applications under strict bandwidth constraints, remains underexplored. The inherent heterogeneity and spatiotemporal complexity of tactile data further complicate this challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce TaCo, the first comprehensive benchmark for Tactile data Codecs. TaCo evaluates 30 compression methods, including off-the-shelf compression algorithms and neural codecs, across five diverse datasets from various sensor types. We systematically assess both lossless and lossy compression schemes on four key tasks: lossless storage, human visualization, material and object classification, and dexterous robotic grasping. Notably, we pioneer the development of data-driven codecs explicitly trained on tactile data, TaCo-LL (lossless) and TaCo-L (lossy). Results have validated the superior performance of our TaCo-LL and TaCo-L. This benchmark provides a foundational framework for understanding the critical trade-offs between compression efficiency and task performance, paving the way for future advances in tactile perception.

### TriPilot-FF: Coordinated Whole-Body Teleoperation with Force Feedback
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09888v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09888v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09888v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09888v1)

Mobile manipulators broaden the operational envelope for robot manipulation. However, the whole-body teleoperation of such robots remains a problem: operators must coordinate a wheeled base and two arms while reasoning about obstacles and contact. Existing interfaces are predominantly hand-centric (e.g., VR controllers and joysticks), leaving foot-operated channels underexplored for continuous base control. We present TriPilot-FF, an open-source whole-body teleoperation system for a custom bimanual mobile manipulator that introduces a foot-operated pedal with lidar-driven pedal haptics, coupled with upper-body bimanual leader-follower teleoperation. Using only a low-cost base-mounted lidar, TriPilot-FF renders a resistive pedal cue from proximity-to-obstacle signals in the commanded direction, shaping operator commands toward collision-averse behaviour without an explicit collision-avoidance controller. The system also supports arm-side force reflection for contact awareness and provides real-time force and visual guidance of bimanual manipulability to prompt mobile base repositioning, thereby improving reach. We demonstrate the capability of TriPilot-FF to effectively ``co-pilot'' the human operator over long time-horizons and tasks requiring precise mobile base movement and coordination. Finally, we incorporate teleoperation feedback signals into an Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) policy and demonstrate improved performance when the additional information is available. We release the pedal device design, full software stack, and conduct extensive real-world evaluations on a bimanual wheeled platform. The project page of TriPilot-FF is http://bit.ly/46H3ZJT.

### BagelVLA: Enhancing Long-Horizon Manipulation via Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09849v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09849v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09849v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09849v1)

Equipping embodied agents with the ability to reason about tasks, foresee physical outcomes, and generate precise actions is essential for general-purpose manipulation. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained foundation models, they typically focus on either linguistic planning or visual forecasting in isolation. These methods rarely integrate both capabilities simultaneously to guide action generation, leading to suboptimal performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose BagelVLA, a unified model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation within a single framework. Initialized from a pretrained unified understanding and generative model, BagelVLA is trained to interleave textual reasoning and visual prediction directly into the action execution loop. To efficiently couple these modalities, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG), which initializes from current observation and leverages single-step denoising to extract predictive visual features, guiding action generation with minimal latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BagelVLA outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin on multiple simulated and real-world benchmarks, particularly in tasks requiring multi-stage reasoning.

The possibility to create reactive robot programs faster without the need for extensively trained programmers is becoming increasingly important. So far, it has not been explored how various techniques for creating Behavior Tree (BT) program representations could be combined with complete graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to allow a human user to validate and edit trees suggested by automated methods. In this paper, we introduce BEhavior TRee GUI (BETR-GUI) for creating BTs with the help of an AI assistant that combines methods using large language models, planning, genetic programming, and Bayesian optimization with a drag-and-drop editor. A user study with 60 participants shows that by combining different assistive methods, BETR-GUI enables users to perform better at solving the robot programming tasks. The results also show that humans using the full variant of BETR-GUI perform better than the AI assistant running on its own.

Reinforcement learning necessitates meticulous reward shaping by specialists to elicit target behaviors, while imitation learning relies on costly task-specific data. In contrast, unsupervised skill discovery can potentially reduce these burdens by learning a diverse repertoire of useful skills driven by intrinsic motivation. However, existing methods exhibit two key limitations: they typically rely on a single policy to master a versatile repertoire of behaviors without modeling the shared structure or distinctions among them, which results in low learning efficiency; moreover, they are susceptible to reward hacking, where the reward signal increases and converges rapidly while the learned skills display insufficient actual diversity. In this work, we introduce an Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE) architecture that prevents diverse behaviors from collapsing into overlapping representations, enabling a single policy to master a wide spectrum of locomotion skills. In addition, we design a multi-discriminator framework in which different discriminators operate on distinct observation spaces, effectively mitigating reward hacking. We evaluated our method on the 12-DOF Unitree A1 quadruped robot, demonstrating a diverse set of locomotion skills. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework boosts training efficiency and yields an 18.3\% expansion in state-space coverage compared to the baseline.

### NavDreamer: Video Models as Zero-Shot 3D Navigators

Previous Vision-Language-Action models face critical limitations in navigation: scarce, diverse data from labor-intensive collection and static representations that fail to capture temporal dynamics and physical laws. We propose NavDreamer, a video-based framework for 3D navigation that leverages generative video models as a universal interface between language instructions and navigation trajectories. Our main hypothesis is that video's ability to encode spatiotemporal information and physical dynamics, combined with internet-scale availability, enables strong zero-shot generalization in navigation. To mitigate the stochasticity of generative predictions, we introduce a sampling-based optimization method that utilizes a VLM for trajectory scoring and selection. An inverse dynamics model is employed to decode executable waypoints from generated video plans for navigation. To systematically evaluate this paradigm in several video model backbones, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering object navigation, precise navigation, spatial grounding, language control, and scene reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate robust generalization across novel objects and unseen environments, with ablation studies revealing that navigation's high-level decision-making nature makes it particularly suited for video-based planning.

### Rethinking Visual-Language-Action Model Scaling: Alignment, Mixture, and Regularization

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong promise for generalist robot control, it remains unclear whether -- and under what conditions -- the standard "scale data" recipe translates to robotics, where training data is inherently heterogeneous across embodiments, sensors, and action spaces. We present a systematic, controlled study of VLA scaling that revisits core training choices for pretraining across diverse robots. Using a representative VLA framework that combines a vision-language backbone with flow-matching, we ablate key design decisions under matched conditions and evaluate in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments. To improve the reliability of real-world results, we introduce a Grouped Blind Ensemble protocol that blinds operators to model identity and separates policy execution from outcome judgment, reducing experimenter bias. Our analysis targets three dimensions of VLA scaling. (1) Physical alignment: we show that a unified end-effector (EEF)-relative action representation is critical for robust cross-embodiment transfer. (2) Embodiment mixture: we find that naively pooling heterogeneous robot datasets often induces negative transfer rather than gains, underscoring the fragility of indiscriminate data scaling. (3) Training regularization: we observe that intuitive strategies, such as sensory dropout and multi-stage fine-tuning, do not consistently improve performance at scale. Together, this study challenge some common assumptions about embodied scaling and provide practical guidance for training large-scale VLA policies from diverse robotic data.

### Fast Motion Planning for Non-Holonomic Mobile Robots via a Rectangular Corridor Representation of Structured Environments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09714v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09714v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09714v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09714v1)

We present a complete framework for fast motion planning of non-holonomic autonomous mobile robots in highly complex but structured environments. Conventional grid-based planners struggle with scalability, while many kinematically-feasible planners impose a significant computational burden due to their search space complexity. To overcome these limitations, our approach introduces a deterministic free-space decomposition that creates a compact graph of overlapping rectangular corridors. This method enables a significant reduction in the search space, without sacrificing path resolution. The framework then performs online motion planning by finding a sequence of rectangles and generating a near-time-optimal, kinematically-feasible trajectory using an analytical planner. The result is a highly efficient solution for large-scale navigation. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and on a physical robot. The implementation is publicly available as open-source software.

### RANT: Ant-Inspired Multi-Robot Rainforest Exploration Using Particle Filter Localisation and Virtual Pheromone Coordination

This paper presents RANT, an ant-inspired multi-robot exploration framework for noisy, uncertain environments. A team of differential-drive robots navigates a 10 x 10 m terrain, collects noisy probe measurements of a hidden richness field, and builds local probabilistic maps while the supervisor maintains a global evaluation. RANT combines particle-filter localisation, a behaviour-based controller with gradient-driven hotspot exploitation, and a lightweight no-revisit coordination mechanism based on virtual pheromone blocking. We experimentally analyse how team size, localisation fidelity, and coordination influence coverage, hotspot recall, and redundancy. Results show that particle filtering is essential for reliable hotspot engagement, coordination substantially reduces overlap, and increasing team size improves coverage but yields diminishing returns due to interference.

### AutoFly: Vision-Language-Action Model for UAV Autonomous Navigation in the Wild

Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires intelligent agents to navigate environments by interpreting linguistic instructions alongside visual observations, serving as a cornerstone task in Embodied AI. Current VLN research for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relies on detailed, pre-specified instructions to guide the UAV along predetermined routes. However, real-world outdoor exploration typically occurs in unknown environments where detailed navigation instructions are unavailable. Instead, only coarse-grained positional or directional guidance can be provided, requiring UAVs to autonomously navigate through continuous planning and obstacle avoidance. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoFly, an end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for autonomous UAV navigation. AutoFly incorporates a pseudo-depth encoder that derives depth-aware features from RGB inputs to enhance spatial reasoning, coupled with a progressive two-stage training strategy that effectively aligns visual, depth, and linguistic representations with action policies. Moreover, existing VLN datasets have fundamental limitations for real-world autonomous navigation, stemming from their heavy reliance on explicit instruction-following over autonomous decision-making and insufficient real-world data. To address these issues, we construct a novel autonomous navigation dataset that shifts the paradigm from instruction-following to autonomous behavior modeling through: (1) trajectory collection emphasizing continuous obstacle avoidance, autonomous planning, and recognition workflows; (2) comprehensive real-world data integration. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoFly achieves a 3.9% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA baselines, with consistent performance across simulated and real environments.

### TeleGate: Whole-Body Humanoid Teleoperation via Gated Expert Selection with Motion Prior

Real-time whole-body teleoperation is a critical method for humanoid robots to perform complex tasks in unstructured environments. However, developing a unified controller that robustly supports diverse human motions remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically distill multiple expert policies into a single general policy, which often inevitably leads to performance degradation, particularly on highly dynamic motions. This paper presents TeleGate, a unified whole-body teleoperation framework for humanoid robots that achieves high-precision tracking across various motions while avoiding the performance loss inherent in knowledge distillation. Our key idea is to preserve the full capability of domain-specific expert policies by training a lightweight gating network, which dynamically activates experts in real-time based on proprioceptive states and reference trajectories. Furthermore, to compensate for the absence of future reference trajectories in real-time teleoperation, we introduce a VAE-based motion prior module that extracts implicit future motion intent from historical observations, enabling anticipatory control for motions requiring prediction such as jumping and standing up. We conducted empirical evaluations in simulation and also deployed our technique on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Using only 2.5 hours of motion capture data for training, our TeleGate achieves high-precision real-time teleoperation across diverse dynamic motions (e.g., running, fall recovery, and jumping), significantly outperforming the baseline methods in both tracking accuracy and success rate.

### AnyTouch 2: General Optical Tactile Representation Learning For Dynamic Tactile Perception

Real-world contact-rich manipulation demands robots to perceive temporal tactile feedback, capture subtle surface deformations, and reason about object properties as well as force dynamics. Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate consistent and strong performance across sensors and tasks.

### Preference Aligned Visuomotor Diffusion Policies for Deformable Object Manipulation

Humans naturally develop preferences for how manipulation tasks should be performed, which are often subtle, personal, and difficult to articulate. Although it is important for robots to account for these preferences to increase personalization and user satisfaction, they remain largely underexplored in robotic manipulation, particularly in the context of deformable objects like garments and fabrics. In this work, we study how to adapt pretrained visuomotor diffusion policies to reflect preferred behaviors using limited demonstrations. We introduce RKO, a novel preference-alignment method that combines the benefits of two recent frameworks: RPO and KTO. We evaluate RKO against common preference learning frameworks, including these two, as well as a baseline vanilla diffusion policy, on real-world cloth-folding tasks spanning multiple garments and preference settings. We show that preference-aligned policies (particularly RKO) achieve superior performance and sample efficiency compared to standard diffusion policy fine-tuning. These results highlight the importance and feasibility of structured preference learning for scaling personalized robot behavior in complex deformable object manipulation tasks.

### Sample-Efficient Real-World Dexterous Policy Fine-Tuning via Action-Chunked Critics and Normalizing Flows
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09580v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09580v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09580v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09580v1)

Real-world fine-tuning of dexterous manipulation policies remains challenging due to limited real-world interaction budgets and highly multimodal action distributions. Diffusion-based policies, while expressive, do not permit conservative likelihood-based updates during fine-tuning because action probabilities are intractable. In contrast, conventional Gaussian policies collapse under multimodality, particularly when actions are executed in chunks, and standard per-step critics fail to align with chunked execution, leading to poor credit assignment. We present SOFT-FLOW, a sample-efficient off-policy fine-tuning framework with normalizing flow (NF) to address these challenges. The normalizing flow policy yields exact likelihoods for multimodal action chunks, allowing conservative, stable policy updates through likelihood regularization and thereby improving sample efficiency. An action-chunked critic evaluates entire action sequences, aligning value estimation with the policy's temporal structure and improving long-horizon credit assignment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a likelihood-based, multimodal generative policy combined with chunk-level value learning on real robotic hardware. We evaluate SOFT-FLOW on two challenging dexterous manipulation tasks in the real world: cutting tape with scissors retrieved from a case, and in-hand cube rotation with a palm-down grasp -- both of which require precise, dexterous control over long horizons. On these tasks, SOFT-FLOW achieves stable, sample-efficient adaptation where standard methods struggle.

### Optimal Control of Microswimmers for Trajectory Tracking Using Bayesian Optimization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09563v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09563v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09563v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09563v1)

Trajectory tracking for microswimmers remains a key challenge in microrobotics, where low-Reynolds-number dynamics make control design particularly complex. In this work, we formulate the trajectory tracking problem as an optimal control problem and solve it using a combination of B-spline parametrization with Bayesian optimization, allowing the treatment of high computational costs without requiring complex gradient computations. Applied to a flagellated magnetic swimmer, the proposed method reproduces a variety of target trajectories, including biologically inspired paths observed in experimental studies. We further evaluate the approach on a three-sphere swimmer model, demonstrating that it can adapt to and partially compensate for wall-induced hydrodynamic effects. The proposed optimization strategy can be applied consistently across models of different fidelity, from low-dimensional ODE-based models to high-fidelity PDE-based simulations, showing its robustness and generality. These results highlight the potential of Bayesian optimization as a versatile tool for optimal control strategies in microscale locomotion under complex fluid-structure interactions.

### LLM-Grounded Dynamic Task Planning with Hierarchical Temporal Logic for Human-Aware Multi-Robot Collaboration
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09472v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.09472v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09472v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.09472v1)

While Large Language Models (LLM) enable non-experts to specify open-world multi-robot tasks, the generated plans often lack kinematic feasibility and are not efficient, especially in long-horizon scenarios. Formal methods like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offer correctness and optimal guarantees, but are typically confined to static, offline settings and struggle with computational scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning into hierarchical LTL specifications and solves the corresponding Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning (STAP) problem. Unlike static approaches, our system resolves stochastic environmental changes, such as moving users or updated instructions via a receding horizon planning (RHP) loop with real-time perception, which dynamically refines plans through a hierarchical state space. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in success rate and interaction fluency while minimizing planning latency.
