### MediX-R1: Open Ended Medical Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23363v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23363v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23363v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23363v1)

2026/02/26 18:59 GTM

We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only $\sim51$K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models.

### VGG-T$^3$: Offline Feed-Forward 3D Reconstruction at Scale
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23361v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23361v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23361v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23361v1)

2026/02/26 18:59 GTM

We present a scalable 3D reconstruction model that addresses a critical limitation in offline feed-forward methods: their computational and memory requirements grow quadratically w.r.t. the number of input images. Our approach is built on the key insight that this bottleneck stems from the varying-length Key-Value (KV) space representation of scene geometry, which we distill into a fixed-size Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via test-time training. VGG-T$^3$ (Visual Geometry Grounded Test Time Training) scales linearly w.r.t. the number of input views, similar to online models, and reconstructs a $1k$ image collection in just $54$ seconds, achieving a $11.6\times$ speed-up over baselines that rely on softmax attention. Since our method retains global scene aggregation capability, our point map reconstruction error outperforming other linear-time methods by large margins. Finally, we demonstrate visual localization capabilities of our model by querying the scene representation with unseen images.

### SeeThrough3D: Occlusion Aware 3D Control in Text-to-Image Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23359v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23359v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23359v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23359v1)

2026/02/26 18:59 GTM

We identify occlusion reasoning as a fundamental yet overlooked aspect for 3D layout-conditioned generation. It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts, they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a virtual environment and rendered from desired camera viewpoint. The transparency encodes hidden object regions, enabling the model to reason about occlusions, while the rendered viewpoint provides explicit camera control during generation. We condition a pretrained flow based text-to-image image generation model by introducing a set of visual tokens derived from our rendered 3D representation. Furthermore, we apply masked self-attention to accurately bind each object bounding box to its corresponding textual description, enabling accurate generation of multiple objects without object attribute mixing. To train the model, we construct a synthetic dataset with diverse multi-object scenes with strong inter-object occlusions. SeeThrough3D generalizes effectively to unseen object categories and enables precise 3D layout control with realistic occlusions and consistent camera control.

### A Dataset is Worth 1 MB

A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.

### Sensor Generalization for Adaptive Sensing in Event-based Object Detection via Joint Distribution Training
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23357v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23357v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23357v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23357v1)

Bio-inspired event cameras have recently attracted significant research due to their asynchronous and low-latency capabilities. These features provide a high dynamic range and significantly reduce motion blur. However, because of the novelty in the nature of their output signals, there is a gap in the variability of available data and a lack of extensive analysis of the parameters characterizing their signals. This paper addresses these issues by providing readers with an in-depth understanding of how intrinsic parameters affect the performance of a model trained on event data, specifically for object detection. We also use our findings to expand the capabilities of the downstream model towards sensor-agnostic robustness.

### Scale Can't Overcome Pragmatics: The Impact of Reporting Bias on Vision-Language Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23351v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23351v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23351v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23351v1)

2026/02/26 18:54 GTM

The lack of reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has remained at the forefront of research discourse. We posit that this behavior stems from a reporting bias in their training data. That is, how people communicate about visual content by default omits tacit information needed to supervise some types of reasoning; e.g., "at the game today!" is a more likely caption than "a photo of 37 people standing behind a field". We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5 and Molmo through the lens of theories from pragmatics, and find that reporting bias results in insufficient representation of four reasoning skills (spatial, temporal, negation, and counting), despite the corpora being of web-scale, and/or synthetically generated. With a set of curated benchmarks, we demonstrate that: (i) VLMs perform poorly on the aforementioned types of reasoning suppressed in the training data by reporting bias; (ii) contrary to popular belief, scaling data size, model size, and to multiple languages does not result in emergence of these skills by default; but, promisingly, (iii) incorporating annotations specifically collected to obtain tacit information is effective. Our findings highlight the need for more intentional training data curation methods, rather than counting on scale for emergence of reasoning capabilities.

### Retrieve and Segment: Are a Few Examples Enough to Bridge the Supervision Gap in Open-Vocabulary Segmentation?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23339v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23339v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23339v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23339v1)

2026/02/26 18:45 GTM

Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) extends the zero-shot recognition capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to pixel-level prediction, enabling segmentation of arbitrary categories specified by text prompts. Despite recent progress, OVS lags behind fully supervised approaches due to two challenges: the coarse image-level supervision used to train VLMs and the semantic ambiguity of natural language. We address these limitations by introducing a few-shot setting that augments textual prompts with a support set of pixel-annotated images. Building on this, we propose a retrieval-augmented test-time adapter that learns a lightweight, per-image classifier by fusing textual and visual support features. Unlike prior methods relying on late, hand-crafted fusion, our approach performs learned, per-query fusion, achieving stronger synergy between modalities. The method supports continually expanding support sets, and applies to fine-grained tasks such as personalized segmentation. Experiments show that we significantly narrow the gap between zero-shot and supervised segmentation while preserving open-vocabulary ability.

### ThinkOmni: Lifting Textual Reasoning to Omni-modal Scenarios via Guidance Decoding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23306v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23306v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23306v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23306v1)

2026/02/26 18:10 GTM

Omni-modal reasoning is essential for intelligent systems to understand and draw inferences from diverse data sources. While existing omni-modal large language models (OLLM) excel at perceiving diverse modalities, they lack the complex reasoning abilities of recent large reasoning models (LRM). However, enhancing the reasoning ability of OLLMs through additional training presents significant challenges, including the need for high-quality data, task-specific adaptation, and substantial computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ThinkOmni, a training-free and data-free framework that lifts textual reasoning to omni-modal scenarios. ThinkOmni introduces two key components: 1) LRM-as-a-Guide, which leverages off-the-shelf LRMs to guide the OLLM decoding process; 2) Stepwise Contrastive Scaling, which adaptively balances perception and reasoning signals without manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on six multi-modal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkOmni consistently delivers performance improvements, with main results achieving 70.2 on MathVista and 75.5 on MMAU. Overall, ThinkOmni offers a flexible and generalizable solution for omni-modal reasoning and provides new insights into the generalization and application of reasoning capabilities.

### PRIMA: Pre-training with Risk-integrated Image-Metadata Alignment for Medical Diagnosis via LLM
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23297v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23297v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23297v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23297v1)

2026/02/26 18:07 GTM

Medical diagnosis requires the effective synthesis of visual manifestations and clinical metadata. However, existing methods often treat metadata as isolated tags, failing to exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in clinical descriptions. We propose PRIMA (Pre-training with Risk-integrated Image-Metadata Alignment), a framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge into multi-modal representation learning. We first curate an expert corpus of risk-disease correlations via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to refine Clinical ModernBERT, embedding diagnostic priors into the text encoder. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a dual-encoder pre-training strategy utilizing DINOv3 and our refined BERT, optimized by a suite of four complementary loss functions. These losses are designed to capture multi-granular semantic alignment and handle the ambiguity of clinical correlations through soft labels. Finally, we leverage Qwen-3 to fuse these aligned features for precise disease classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIMA effectively harmonizes pixel-level features with abstract clinical expertise, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework achieves superior robustness without the need for massive data collection or exhaustive computational resources. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.

### ManifoldGD: Training-Free Hierarchical Manifold Guidance for Diffusion-Based Dataset Distillation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23295v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23295v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23295v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23295v1)

2026/02/26 18:07 GTM

In recent times, large datasets hinder efficient model training while also containing redundant concepts. Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact datasets that preserve the knowledge of large-scale training sets while drastically reducing storage and computation. Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled training-free distillation by leveraging pre-trained generative priors; however, existing guidance strategies remain limited. Current score-based methods either perform unguided denoising or rely on simple mode-based guidance toward instance prototype centroids (IPC centroids), which often are rudimentary and suboptimal. We propose Manifold-Guided Distillation (ManifoldGD), a training-free diffusion-based framework that integrates manifold consistent guidance at every denoising timestep. Our method employs IPCs computed via a hierarchical, divisive clustering of VAE latent features, yielding a multi-scale coreset of IPCs that captures both coarse semantic modes and fine intra-class variability. Using a local neighborhood of the extracted IPC centroids, we create the latent manifold for each diffusion denoising timestep. At each denoising step, we project the mode-alignment vector onto the local tangent space of the estimated latent manifold, thus constraining the generation trajectory to remain manifold-faithful while preserving semantic consistency. This formulation improves representativeness, diversity, and image fidelity without requiring any model retraining. Empirical results demonstrate consistent gains over existing training-free and training-based baselines in terms of FID, l2 distance among real and synthetic dataset embeddings, and classification accuracy, establishing ManifoldGD as the first geometry-aware training-free data distillation framework.

### Towards Long-Form Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23294v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23294v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23294v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23294v1)

In real scenarios, videos can span several minutes or even hours. However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos. Experiments on newly extended LF-STVG datasets show that ART-STVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving competitive performance on conventional short-form STVG.

### PGVMS: A Prompt-Guided Unified Framework for Virtual Multiplex IHC Staining with Pathological Semantic Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23292v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23292v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23292v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23292v1)

2026/02/26 18:03 GTM

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining enables precise molecular profiling of protein expression, with over 200 clinically available antibody-based tests in modern pathology. However, comprehensive IHC analysis is frequently limited by insufficient tissue quantities in small biopsies. Therefore, virtual multiplex staining emerges as an innovative solution to digitally transform H&E images into multiple IHC representations, yet current methods still face three critical challenges: (1) inadequate semantic guidance for multi-staining, (2) inconsistent distribution of immunochemistry staining, and (3) spatial misalignment across different stain modalities. To overcome these limitations, we present a prompt-guided framework for virtual multiplex IHC staining using only uniplex training data (PGVMS). Our framework introduces three key innovations corresponding to each challenge: First, an adaptive prompt guidance mechanism employing a pathological visual language model dynamically adjusts staining prompts to resolve semantic guidance limitations (Challenge 1). Second, our protein-aware learning strategy (PALS) maintains precise protein expression patterns by direct quantification and constraint of protein distributions (Challenge 2). Third, the prototype-consistent learning strategy (PCLS) establishes cross-image semantic interaction to correct spatial misalignments (Challenge 3).

### LineGraph2Road: Structural Graph Reasoning on Line Graphs for Road Network Extraction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23290v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23290v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23290v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23290v1)

2026/02/26 18:02 GTM

The accurate and automatic extraction of roads from satellite imagery is critical for applications in navigation and urban planning, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation. Many existing methods decompose this task into keypoint extraction and connectedness prediction, but often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex topologies. Here, we propose LineGraph2Road, a framework that improves connectedness prediction by formulating it as binary classification over edges in a constructed global but sparse Euclidean graph, where nodes are keypoints extracted from segmentation masks and edges connect node pairs within a predefined distance threshold, representing potential road segments. To better learn structural link representation, we transform the original graph into its corresponding line graph and apply a Graph Transformer on it for connectedness prediction. This formulation overcomes the limitations of endpoint-embedding fusion on set-isomorphic links, enabling rich link representations and effective relational reasoning over the global structure. Additionally, we introduce an overpass/underpass head to resolve multi-level crossings and a coupled NMS strategy to preserve critical connections. We evaluate LineGraph2Road on three benchmarks: City-scale, SpaceNet, and Global-scale, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two key metrics, TOPO-F1 and APLS. It also captures fine visual details critical for real-world deployment. We will make our code publicly available.

### Decomposing Private Image Generation via Coarse-to-Fine Wavelet Modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23262v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23262v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23262v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23262v1)

Generative models trained on sensitive image datasets risk memorizing and reproducing individual training examples, making strong privacy guarantees essential. While differential privacy (DP) provides a principled framework for such guarantees, standard DP finetuning (e.g., with DP-SGD) often results in severe degradation of image quality, particularly in high-frequency textures, due to the indiscriminate addition of noise across all model parameters. In this work, we propose a spectral DP framework based on the hypothesis that the most privacy-sensitive portions of an image are often low-frequency components in the wavelet space (e.g., facial features and object shapes) while high-frequency components are largely generic and public. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the following two-stage framework for DP image generation with coarse image intermediaries: (1) DP finetune an autoregressive spectral image tokenizer model on the low-resolution wavelet coefficients of the sensitive images, and (2) perform high-resolution upsampling using a publicly pretrained super-resolution model. By restricting the privacy budget to the global structures of the image in the first stage, and leveraging the post-processing property of DP for detail refinement, we achieve promising trade-offs between privacy and utility. Experiments on the MS-COCO and MM-CelebA-HQ datasets show that our method generates images with improved quality and style capture relative to other leading DP image frameworks.

### Risk-Aware World Model Predictive Control for Generalizable End-to-End Autonomous Driving
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23259v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23259v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23259v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23259v1)

With advances in imitation learning (IL) and large-scale driving datasets, end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has made great progress recently. Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of "only driving like the expert" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration. Extensive experiments show that RaWMPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while providing superior decision interpretability.

### Spatio-Temporal Token Pruning for Efficient High-Resolution GUI Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23235v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23235v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23235v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23235v1)

Pure-vision GUI agents provide universal interaction capabilities but suffer from severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the massive spatiotemporal redundancy inherent in high-resolution screenshots and historical trajectories. We identify two critical misalignments in existing compression paradigms: the temporal mismatch, where uniform history encoding diverges from the agent's "fading memory" attention pattern, and the spatial topology conflict, where unstructured pruning compromises the grid integrity required for precise coordinate grounding, inducing spatial hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce GUIPruner, a training-free framework tailored for high-resolution GUI navigation. It synergizes Temporal-Adaptive Resolution (TAR), which eliminates historical redundancy via decay-based resizing, and Stratified Structure-aware Pruning (SSP), which prioritizes interactive foregrounds and semantic anchors while safeguarding global layout. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that GUIPruner consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively preventing the collapse observed in large-scale models under high compression. Notably, on Qwen2-VL-2B, our method delivers a 3.4x reduction in FLOPs and a 3.3x speedup in vision encoding latency while retaining over 94% of the original performance, enabling real-time, high-precision navigation with minimal resource consumption.

### Skarimva: Skeleton-based Action Recognition is a Multi-view Application
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23231v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23231v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23231v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23231v1)

Human action recognition plays an important role when developing intelligent interactions between humans and machines. While there is a lot of active research on improving the machine learning algorithms for skeleton-based action recognition, not much attention has been given to the quality of the input skeleton data itself. This work demonstrates that by making use of multiple camera views to triangulate more accurate 3D~skeletons, the performance of state-of-the-art action recognition models can be improved significantly. This suggests that the quality of the input data is currently a limiting factor for the performance of these models. Based on these results, it is argued that the cost-benefit ratio of using multiple cameras is very favorable in most practical use-cases, therefore future research in skeleton-based action recognition should consider multi-view applications as the standard setup.

### Large Multimodal Models as General In-Context Classifiers
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23229v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23229v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23229v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23229v1)

2026/02/26 17:08 GTM

Which multimodal model should we use for classification? Previous studies suggest that the answer lies in CLIP-like contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), due to their remarkable performance in zero-shot classification. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are more suitable for complex tasks. In this work, we argue that this answer overlooks an important capability of LMMs: in-context learning. We benchmark state-of-the-art LMMs on diverse datasets for closed-world classification and find that, although their zero-shot performance is lower than CLIP's, LMMs with a few in-context examples can match or even surpass contrastive VLMs with cache-based adapters, their "in-context" equivalent. We extend this analysis to the open-world setting, where the generative nature of LMMs makes them more suitable for the task. In this challenging scenario, LMMs struggle whenever provided with imperfect context information. To address this issue, we propose CIRCLE, a simple training-free method that assigns pseudo-labels to in-context examples, iteratively refining them with the available context itself. Through extensive experiments, we show that CIRCLE establishes a robust baseline for open-world classification, surpassing VLM counterparts and highlighting the potential of LMMs to serve as unified classifiers, and a flexible alternative to specialized models.

### MovieTeller: Tool-augmented Movie Synopsis with ID Consistent Progressive Abstraction

With the explosive growth of digital entertainment, automated video summarization has become indispensable for applications such as content indexing, personalized recommendation, and efficient media archiving. Automatic synopsis generation for long-form videos, such as movies and TV series, presents a significant challenge for existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While proficient at single-image captioning, these general-purpose models often exhibit critical failures in long-duration contexts, primarily a lack of ID-consistent character identification and a fractured narrative coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose MovieTeller, a novel framework for generating movie synopses via tool-augmented progressive abstraction. Our core contribution is a training-free, tool-augmented, fact-grounded generation process. Instead of requiring costly model fine-tuning, our framework directly leverages off-the-shelf models in a plug-and-play manner. We first invoke a specialized face recognition model as an external "tool" to establish Factual Groundings--precise character identities and their corresponding bounding boxes. These groundings are then injected into the prompt to steer the VLM's reasoning, ensuring the generated scene descriptions are anchored to verifiable facts. Furthermore, our progressive abstraction pipeline decomposes the summarization of a full-length movie into a multi-stage process, effectively mitigating the context length limitations of current VLMs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines.

### UniScale: Unified Scale-Aware 3D Reconstruction for Multi-View Understanding via Prior Injection for Robotic Perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23224v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23224v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23224v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23224v1)

We present UniScale, a unified, scale-aware multi-view 3D reconstruction framework for robotic applications that flexibly integrates geometric priors through a modular, semantically informed design. In vision-based robotic navigation, the accurate extraction of environmental structure from raw image sequences is critical for downstream tasks. UniScale addresses this challenge with a single feed-forward network that jointly estimates camera intrinsics and extrinsics, scale-invariant depth and point maps, and the metric scale of a scene from multi-view images, while optionally incorporating auxiliary geometric priors when available. By combining global contextual reasoning with camera-aware feature representations, UniScale is able to recover the metric-scale of the scene. In robotic settings where camera intrinsics are known, they can be easily incorporated to improve performance, with additional gains obtained when camera poses are also available. This co-design enables robust, metric-aware 3D reconstruction within a single unified model. Importantly, UniScale does not require training from scratch, and leverages world priors exhibited in pre-existing models without geometric encoding strategies, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained robotic teams. We evaluate UniScale on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and consistent performance across diverse environments. We will release our implementation upon acceptance.

### Multidimensional Task Learning: A Unified Tensor Framework for Computer Vision Tasks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23217v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23217v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23217v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23217v1)

2026/02/26 17:00 GTM

This paper introduces Multidimensional Task Learning (MTL), a unified mathematical framework based on Generalized Einstein MLPs (GE-MLPs) that operate directly on tensors via the Einstein product. We argue that current computer vision task formulations are inherently constrained by matrix-based thinking: standard architectures rely on matrix-valued weights and vectorvalued biases, requiring structural flattening that restricts the space of naturally expressible tasks. GE-MLPs lift this constraint by operating with tensor-valued parameters, enabling explicit control over which dimensions are preserved or contracted without information loss. Through rigorous mathematical derivations, we demonstrate that classification, segmentation, and detection are special cases of MTL, differing only in their dimensional configuration within a formally defined task space. We further prove that this task space is strictly larger than what matrix-based formulations can natively express, enabling principled task configurations such as spatiotemporal or cross modal predictions that require destructive flattening under conventional approaches. This work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing computer vision tasks through the lens of tensor algebra.

### Plug-and-Play Diffusion Meets ADMM: Dual-Variable Coupling for Robust Medical Image Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23214v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23214v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23214v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23214v1)

2026/02/26 16:58 GTM

Plug-and-Play diffusion prior (PnPDP) frameworks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving imaging inverse problems by treating pretrained generative models as modular priors. However, we identify a critical flaw in prevailing PnP solvers (e.g., based on HQS or Proximal Gradient): they function as memoryless operators, updating estimates solely based on instantaneous gradients. This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold. However, this rigorous geometric coupling introduces a secondary challenge: the accumulated dual residuals exhibit spectrally colored, structured artifacts that violate the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) assumption of diffusion priors, causing severe hallucinations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spectral Homogenization (SH), a frequency-domain adaptation mechanism that modulates these structured residuals into statistically compliant pseudo-AWGN inputs. This effectively aligns the solver's rigorous optimization trajectory with the denoiser's valid statistical manifold. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our approach resolves the bias-hallucination trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity with significantly accelerated convergence.

### Through BrokenEyes: How Eye Disorders Impact Face Detection?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23212v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23212v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23212v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23212v1)

2026/02/26 16:56 GTM

Vision disorders significantly impact millions of lives, altering how visual information is processed and perceived. In this work, a computational framework was developed using the BrokenEyes system to simulate five common eye disorders: Age-related macular degeneration, cataract, glaucoma, refractive errors, and diabetic retinopathy and analyze their effects on neural-like feature representations in deep learning models. Leveraging a combination of human and non-human datasets, models trained under normal and disorder-specific conditions revealed critical disruptions in feature maps, particularly for cataract and glaucoma, which align with known neural processing challenges in these conditions. Evaluation metrics such as activation energy and cosine similarity quantified the severity of these distortions, providing insights into the interplay between degraded visual inputs and learned representations.

### EmbodMocap: In-the-Wild 4D Human-Scene Reconstruction for Embodied Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23205v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23205v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23205v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23205v1)

2026/02/26 16:53 GTM

Human behaviors in the real world naturally encode rich, long-term contextual information that can be leveraged to train embodied agents for perception, understanding, and acting. However, existing capture systems typically rely on costly studio setups and wearable devices, limiting the large-scale collection of scene-conditioned human motion data in the wild. To address this, we propose EmbodMocap, a portable and affordable data collection pipeline using two moving iPhones. Our key idea is to jointly calibrate dual RGB-D sequences to reconstruct both humans and scenes within a unified metric world coordinate frame. The proposed method allows metric-scale and scene-consistent capture in everyday environments without static cameras or markers, bridging human motion and scene geometry seamlessly. Compared with optical capture ground truth, we demonstrate that the dual-view setting exhibits a remarkable ability to mitigate depth ambiguity, achieving superior alignment and reconstruction performance over single iphone or monocular models. Based on the collected data, we empower three embodied AI tasks: monocular human-scene-reconstruction, where we fine-tune on feedforward models that output metric-scale, world-space aligned humans and scenes; physics-based character animation, where we prove our data could be used to scale human-object interaction skills and scene-aware motion tracking; and robot motion control, where we train a humanoid robot via sim-to-real RL to replicate human motions depicted in videos. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pipeline and its contributions towards advancing embodied AI research.

### Motion-aware Event Suppression for Event Cameras
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23204v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23204v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23204v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23204v1)

2026/02/26 16:53 GTM

In this work, we introduce the first framework for Motion-aware Event Suppression, which learns to filter events triggered by IMOs and ego-motion in real time. Our model jointly segments IMOs in the current event stream while predicting their future motion, enabling anticipatory suppression of dynamic events before they occur. Our lightweight architecture achieves 173 Hz inference on consumer-grade GPUs with less than 1 GB of memory usage, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on the challenging EVIMO benchmark by 67\% in segmentation accuracy while operating at a 53\% higher inference rate. Moreover, we demonstrate significant benefits for downstream applications: our method accelerates Vision Transformer inference by 83\% via token pruning and improves event-based visual odometry accuracy, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 13\%.

### ColoDiff: Integrating Dynamic Consistency With Content Awareness for Colonoscopy Video Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23203v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23203v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23203v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23203v1)

2026/02/26 16:51 GTM

Colonoscopy video generation delivers dynamic, information-rich data critical for diagnosing intestinal diseases, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. High-quality video generation demands temporal consistency and precise control over clinical attributes, but faces challenges from irregular intestinal structures, diverse disease representations, and various imaging modalities. To this end, we propose ColoDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates dynamic-consistent and content-aware colonoscopy videos, aiming to alleviate data shortage and assist clinical analysis. At the inter-frame level, our TimeStream module decouples temporal dependency from video sequences through a cross-frame tokenization mechanism, enabling intricate dynamic modeling despite irregular intestinal structures. At the intra-frame level, our Content-Aware module incorporates noise-injected embeddings and learnable prototypes to realize precise control over clinical attributes, breaking through the coarse guidance of diffusion models. Additionally, ColoDiff employs a non-Markovian sampling strategy that cuts steps by over 90% for real-time generation. ColoDiff is evaluated across three public datasets and one hospital database, based on both generation metrics and downstream tasks including disease diagnosis, modality discrimination, bowel preparation scoring, and lesion segmentation. Extensive experiments show ColoDiff generates videos with smooth transitions and rich dynamics. ColoDiff presents an effort in controllable colonoscopy video generation, revealing the potential of synthetic videos in complementing authentic representation and mitigating data scarcity in clinical settings.

### FairQuant: Fairness-Aware Mixed-Precision Quantization for Medical Image Classification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23192v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23192v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23192v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23192v1)

2026/02/26 16:44 GTM

Compressing neural networks by quantizing model parameters offers useful trade-off between performance and efficiency. Methods like quantization-aware training and post-training quantization strive to maintain the downstream performance of compressed models compared to the full precision models. However, these techniques do not explicitly consider the impact on algorithmic fairness. In this work, we study fairness-aware mixed-precision quantization schemes for medical image classification under explicit bit budgets. We introduce FairQuant, a framework that combines group-aware importance analysis, budgeted mixed-precision allocation, and a learnable Bit-Aware Quantization (BAQ) mode that jointly optimizes weights and per-unit bit allocations under bitrate and fairness regularization. We evaluate the method on Fitzpatrick17k and ISIC2019 across ResNet18/50, DeiT-Tiny, and TinyViT. Results show that FairQuant configurations with average precision near 4-6 bits recover much of the Uniform 8-bit accuracy while improving worst-group performance relative to Uniform 4- and 8-bit baselines, with comparable fairness metrics under shared budgets.

### Uni-Animator: Towards Unified Visual Colorization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23191v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23191v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23191v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23191v1)

2026/02/26 16:44 GTM

We propose Uni-Animator, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework for unified image and video sketch colorization. Existing sketch colorization methods struggle to unify image and video tasks, suffering from imprecise color transfer with single or multiple references, inadequate preservation of high-frequency physical details, and compromised temporal coherence with motion artifacts in large-motion scenes. To tackle imprecise color transfer, we introduce visual reference enhancement via instance patch embedding, enabling precise alignment and fusion of reference color information. To resolve insufficient physical detail preservation, we design physical detail reinforcement using physical features that effectively capture and retain high-frequency textures. To mitigate motion-induced temporal inconsistency, we propose sketch-based dynamic RoPE encoding that adaptively models motion-aware spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Uni-Animator achieves competitive performance on both image and video sketch colorization, matching that of task-specific methods while unlocking unified cross-domain capabilities with high detail fidelity and robust temporal consistency.

### Phys-3D: Physics-Constrained Real-Time Crowd Tracking and Counting on Railway Platforms
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23177v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23177v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23177v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23177v1)

2026/02/26 16:38 GTM

Accurate, real-time crowd counting on railway platforms is essential for safety and capacity management. We propose to use a single camera mounted in a train, scanning the platform while arriving. While hardware constraints are simple, counting remains challenging due to dense occlusions, camera motion, and perspective distortions during train arrivals. Most existing tracking-by-detection approaches assume static cameras or ignore physical consistency in motion modeling, leading to unreliable counting under dynamic conditions. We propose a physics-constrained tracking framework that unifies detection, appearance, and 3D motion reasoning in a real-time pipeline. Our approach integrates a transfer-learned YOLOv11m detector with EfficientNet-B0 appearance encoding within DeepSORT, while introducing a physics-constrained Kalman model (Phys-3D) that enforces physically plausible 3D motion dynamics through pinhole geometry. To address counting brittleness under occlusions, we implement a virtual counting band with persistence. On our platform benchmark, MOT-RailwayPlatformCrowdHead Dataset(MOT-RPCH), our method reduces counting error to 2.97%, demonstrating robust performance despite motion and occlusions. Our results show that incorporating first-principles geometry and motion priors enables reliable crowd counting in safety-critical transportation scenarios, facilitating effective train scheduling and platform safety management.

### Latent Gaussian Splatting for 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23172v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23172v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23172v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23172v1)

2026/02/26 16:34 GTM

Capturing 4D spatiotemporal surroundings is crucial for the safe and reliable operation of robots in dynamic environments. However, most existing methods address only one side of the problem: they either provide coarse geometric tracking via bounding boxes, or detailed 3D structures like voxel-based occupancy that lack explicit temporal association. In this work, we present Latent Gaussian Splatting for 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking (LaGS) that advances spatiotemporal scene understanding in a holistic direction. Our approach incorporates camera-based end-to-end tracking with mask-based multi-view panoptic occupancy prediction, and addresses the key challenge of efficiently aggregating multi-view information into 3D voxel grids via a novel latent Gaussian splatting approach. Specifically, we first fuse observations into 3D Gaussians that serve as a sparse point-centric latent representation of the 3D scene, and then splat the aggregated features onto a 3D voxel grid that is decoded by a mask-based segmentation head. We evaluate LaGS on the Occ3D nuScenes and Waymo datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance for 4D panoptic occupancy tracking. We make our code available at https://lags.cs.uni-freiburg.de/.

### Learning Continuous Wasserstein Barycenter Space for Generalized All-in-One Image Restoration
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23169v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23169v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23169v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23169v1)

2026/02/26 16:31 GTM

Despite substantial advances in all-in-one image restoration for addressing diverse degradations within a unified model, existing methods remain vulnerable to out-of-distribution degradations, thereby limiting their generalization in real-world scenarios. To tackle the challenge, this work is motivated by the intuition that multisource degraded feature distributions are induced by different degradation-specific shifts from an underlying degradation-agnostic distribution, and recovering such a shared distribution is thus crucial for achieving generalization across degradations. With this insight, we propose BaryIR, a representation learning framework that aligns multisource degraded features in the Wasserstein barycenter (WB) space, which models a degradation-agnostic distribution by minimizing the average of Wasserstein distances to multisource degraded distributions. We further introduce residual subspaces, whose embeddings are mutually contrasted while remaining orthogonal to the WB embeddings. Consequently, BaryIR explicitly decouples two orthogonal spaces: a WB space that encodes the degradation-agnostic invariant contents shared across degradations, and residual subspaces that adaptively preserve the degradation-specific knowledge. This disentanglement mitigates overfitting to in-distribution degradations and enables adaptive restoration grounded on the degradation-agnostic shared invariance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR performs competitively against state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Notably, BaryIR generalizes well to unseen degradations (\textit{e.g.,} types and levels) and shows remarkable robustness in learning generalized features, even when trained on limited degradation types and evaluated on real-world data with mixed degradations.

### AgentVista: Evaluating Multimodal Agents in Ultra-Challenging Realistic Visual Scenarios
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23166v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23166v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23166v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23166v1)

2026/02/26 16:30 GTM

Real-world multimodal agents solve multi-step workflows grounded in visual evidence. For example, an agent can troubleshoot a device by linking a wiring photo to a schematic and validating the fix with online documentation, or plan a trip by interpreting a transit map and checking schedules under routing constraints. However, existing multimodal benchmarks mainly evaluate single-turn visual reasoning or specific tool skills, and they do not fully capture the realism, visual subtlety, and long-horizon tool use that practical agents require. We introduce AgentVista, a benchmark for generalist multimodal agents that spans 25 sub-domains across 7 categories, pairing realistic and detail-rich visual scenarios with natural hybrid tool use. Tasks require long-horizon tool interactions across modalities, including web search, image search, page navigation, and code-based operations for both image processing and general programming. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models exposes significant gaps in their ability to carry out long-horizon multimodal tool use. Even the best model in our evaluation, Gemini-3-Pro with tools, achieves only 27.3% overall accuracy, and hard instances can require more than 25 tool-calling turns. We expect AgentVista to accelerate the development of more capable and reliable multimodal agents for realistic and ultra-challenging problem solving.

### DyaDiT: A Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Socially Favorable Dyadic Gesture Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23165v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23165v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23165v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23165v1)

2026/02/26 16:30 GTM

Generating realistic conversational gestures are essential for achieving natural, socially engaging interactions with digital humans. However, existing methods typically map a single audio stream to a single speaker's motion, without considering social context or modeling the mutual dynamics between two people engaging in conversation. We present DyaDiT, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that generates contextually appropriate human motion from dyadic audio signals. Trained on Seamless Interaction Dataset, DyaDiT takes dyadic audio with optional social-context tokens to produce context-appropriate motion. It fuses information from both speakers to capture interaction dynamics, uses a motion dictionary to encode motion priors, and can optionally utilize the conversational partner's gestures to produce more responsive motion. We evaluate DyaDiT on standard motion generation metrics and conduct quantitative user studies, demonstrating that it not only surpasses existing methods on objective metrics but is also strongly preferred by users, highlighting its robustness and socially favorable motion generation. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

### Efficient Encoder-Free Fourier-based 3D Large Multimodal Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23153v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23153v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23153v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23153v1)

2026/02/26 16:16 GTM

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that process 3D data typically rely on heavy, pre-trained visual encoders to extract geometric features. While recent 2D LMMs have begun to eliminate such encoders for efficiency and scalability, extending this paradigm to 3D remains challenging due to the unordered and large-scale nature of point clouds. This leaves a critical unanswered question: How can we design an LMM that tokenizes unordered 3D data effectively and efficiently without a cumbersome encoder? We propose Fase3D, the first efficient encoder-free Fourier-based 3D scene LMM. Fase3D tackles the challenges of scalability and permutation invariance with a novel tokenizer that combines point cloud serialization and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to approximate self-attention. This design enables an effective and computationally minimal architecture, built upon three key innovations: First, we represent large scenes compactly via structured superpoints. Second, our space-filling curve serialization followed by an FFT enables efficient global context modeling and graph-based token merging. Lastly, our Fourier-augmented LoRA adapters inject global frequency-aware interactions into the LLMs at a negligible cost. Fase3D achieves performance comparable to encoder-based 3D LMMs while being significantly more efficient in computation and parameters. Project website: https://tev-fbk.github.io/Fase3D.

### Partial recovery of meter-scale surface weather
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23146v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23146v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23146v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23146v1)

2026/02/26 16:11 GTM

Near-surface atmospheric conditions can differ sharply over tens to hundreds of meters due to land cover and topography, yet this variability is absent from current weather analyses and forecasts. It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.

### No Labels, No Look-Ahead: Unsupervised Online Video Stabilization with Classical Priors
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23141v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23141v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23141v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23141v1)

2026/02/26 16:04 GTM

We propose a new unsupervised framework for online video stabilization. Unlike methods based on deep learning that require paired stable and unstable datasets, our approach instantiates the classical stabilization pipeline with three stages and incorporates a multithreaded buffering mechanism. This design addresses three longstanding challenges in end-to-end learning: limited data, poor controllability, and inefficiency on hardware with constrained resources. Existing benchmarks focus mainly on handheld videos with a forward view in visible light, which restricts the applicability of stabilization to domains such as UAV nighttime remote sensing. To fill this gap, we introduce a new multimodal UAV aerial video dataset (UAV-Test). Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online stabilizers in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, while achieving performance comparable to offline methods.

### From Calibration to Refinement: Seeking Certainty via Probabilistic Evidence Propagation for Noisy-Label Person Re-Identification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23133v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23133v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23133v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23133v1)

2026/02/26 15:50 GTM

With the increasing demand for robust person Re-ID in unconstrained environments, learning from datasets with noisy labels and sparse per-identity samples remains a critical challenge. Existing noise-robust person Re-ID methods primarily rely on loss-correction or sample-selection strategies using softmax outputs. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations: 1) Softmax exhibits translation invariance, leading to over-confident and unreliable predictions on corrupted labels. 2) Conventional sample selection based on small-loss criteria often discards valuable hard positives that are crucial for learning discriminative features. To overcome these issues, we propose the CAlibration-to-REfinement (CARE) method, a two-stage framework that seeks certainty through probabilistic evidence propagation from calibration to refinement. In the calibration stage, we propose the probabilistic evidence calibration (PEC) that dismantles softmax translation invariance by injecting adaptive learnable parameters into the similarity function, and employs an evidential calibration loss to mitigate overconfidence on mislabeled samples. In the refinement stage, we design the evidence propagation refinement (EPR) that can more accurately distinguish between clean and noisy samples. Specifically, the EPR contains two steps: Firstly, the composite angular margin (CAM) metric is proposed to precisely distinguish clean but hard-to-learn positive samples from mislabeled ones in a hyperspherical space; Secondly, the certainty-oriented sphere weighting (COSW) is developed to dynamically allocate the importance of samples according to CAM, ensuring clean instances drive model updates. Extensive experimental results on Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and CUHK03 datasets under both random and patterned noises show that CARE achieves competitive performance.

### TriLite: Efficient Weakly Supervised Object Localization with Universal Visual Features and Tri-Region Disentanglement
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23120v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23120v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23120v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23120v1)

2026/02/26 15:33 GTM

Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to localize target objects in images using only image-level labels. Despite recent progress, many approaches still rely on multi-stage pipelines or full fine-tuning of large backbones, which increases training cost, while the broader WSOL community continues to face the challenge of partial object coverage. We present TriLite, a single-stage WSOL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer with Dinov2 pre-training in a self-supervised manner, and introduces only a minimal number of trainable parameters (fewer than 800K on ImageNet-1K) for both classification and localization. At its core is the proposed TriHead module, which decomposes patch features into foreground, background, and ambiguous regions, thereby improving object coverage while suppressing spurious activations. By disentangling classification and localization objectives, TriLite effectively exploits the universal representations learned by self-supervised ViTs without requiring expensive end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and OpenImages demonstrate that TriLite sets a new state of the art, while remaining significantly more parameter-efficient and easier to train than prior methods. The code will be released soon.

### Devling into Adversarial Transferability on Image Classification: Review, Benchmark, and Evaluation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23117v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23117v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23117v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23117v1)

2026/02/26 15:30 GTM

Adversarial transferability refers to the capacity of adversarial examples generated on the surrogate model to deceive alternate, unexposed victim models. This property eliminates the need for direct access to the victim model during an attack, thereby raising considerable security concerns in practical applications and attracting substantial research attention recently. In this work, we discern a lack of a standardized framework and criteria for evaluating transfer-based attacks, leading to potentially biased assessments of existing approaches. To rectify this gap, we have conducted an exhaustive review of hundreds of related works, organizing various transfer-based attacks into six distinct categories. Subsequently, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to serve as a benchmark for evaluating these attacks. In addition, we delineate common strategies that enhance adversarial transferability and highlight prevalent issues that could lead to unfair comparisons. Finally, we provide a brief review of transfer-based attacks beyond image classification.

### FLIGHT: Fibonacci Lattice-based Inference for Geometric Heading in real-Time

Estimating camera motion from monocular video is a fundamental problem in computer vision, central to tasks such as SLAM, visual odometry, and structure-from-motion. Existing methods that recover the camera's heading under known rotation, whether from an IMU or an optimization algorithm, tend to perform well in low-noise, low-outlier conditions, but often decrease in accuracy or become computationally expensive as noise and outlier levels increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalization of the Hough transform on the unit sphere (S(2)) to estimate the camera's heading. First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency. Additionally, experiments on SLAM show that the proposed method reduces RMSE by correcting the heading during camera pose initialization.

### WARM-CAT: : Warm-Started Test-Time Comprehensive Knowledge Accumulation for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23114v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23114v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23114v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23114v1)

Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual prototypes from historical images for inference. Since the model tends to favor compositions already stored in the queue during testing, we warm-start the queue by initializing it with training images for visual prototypes of seen compositions and generating unseen visual prototypes using the mapping learned between seen and unseen textual prototypes. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. To provide a more reliable evaluation for CZSL, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, C-Fashion, and refine the widely used but noisy MIT-States dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/xud-yan/WARM-CAT .

### SpectralMamba-UNet: Frequency-Disentangled State Space Modeling for Texture-Structure Consistent Medical Image Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23103v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23103v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23103v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23103v1)

Accurate medical image segmentation requires effective modeling of both global anatomical structures and fine-grained boundary details. Recent state space models (e.g., Vision Mamba) offer efficient long-range dependency modeling. However, their one-dimensional serialization weakens local spatial continuity and high-frequency representation. To this end, we propose SpectralMamba-UNet, a novel frequency-disentangled framework to decouple the learning of structural and textural information in the spectral domain. Our Spectral Decomposition and Modeling (SDM) module applies discrete cosine transform to decompose low- and high-frequency features, where low frequency contributes to global contextual modeling via a frequency-domain Mamba and high frequency preserves boundary-sensitive details. To balance spectral contributions, we introduce a Spectral Channel Reweighting (SCR) mechanism to form channel-wise frequency-aware attention, and a Spectral-Guided Fusion (SGF) module to achieve adaptively multi-scale fusion in the decoder. Experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements across diverse modalities and segmentation targets, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

### Locally Adaptive Decay Surfaces for High-Speed Face and Landmark Detection with Event Cameras
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23101v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23101v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23101v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23101v1)

Event cameras record luminance changes with microsecond resolution, but converting their sparse, asynchronous output into dense tensors that neural networks can exploit remains a core challenge. Conventional histograms or globally-decayed time-surface representations apply fixed temporal parameters across the entire image plane, which in practice creates a trade-off between preserving spatial structure during still periods and retaining sharp edges during rapid motion. We introduce Locally Adaptive Decay Surfaces (LADS), a family of event representations in which the temporal decay at each location is modulated according to local signal dynamics. Three strategies are explored, based on event rate, Laplacian-of-Gaussian response, and high-frequency spectral energy. These adaptive schemes preserve detail in quiescent regions while reducing blur in regions of dense activity. Extensive experiments on the public data show that LADS consistently improves both face detection and facial landmark accuracy compared to standard non-adaptive representations. At 30 Hz, LADS achieves higher detection accuracy and lower landmark error than either baseline, and at 240 Hz it mitigates the accuracy decline typically observed at higher frequencies, sustaining 2.44 % normalized mean error for landmarks and 0.966 mAP50 in face detection. These high-frequency results even surpass the accuracy reported in prior works operating at 30 Hz, setting new benchmarks for event-based face analysis. Moreover, by preserving spatial structure at the representation stage, LADS supports the use of much lighter network architectures while still retaining real-time performance. These results highlight the importance of context-aware temporal integration for neuromorphic vision and point toward real-time, high-frequency human-computer interaction systems that exploit the unique advantages of event cameras.

### Cytoarchitecture in Words: Weakly Supervised Vision-Language Modeling for Human Brain Microscopy
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23088v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23088v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23088v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23088v1)

Foundation models increasingly offer potential to support interactive, agentic workflows that assist researchers during analysis and interpretation of image data. Such workflows often require coupling vision to language to provide a natural-language interface. However, paired image-text data needed to learn this coupling are scarce and difficult to obtain in many research and clinical settings. One such setting is microscopic analysis of cell-body-stained histological human brain sections, which enables the study of cytoarchitecture: cell density and morphology and their laminar and areal organization. Here, we propose a label-mediated method that generates meaningful captions from images by linking images and text only through a label, without requiring curated paired image-text data. Given the label, we automatically mine area descriptions from related literature and use them as synthetic captions reflecting canonical cytoarchitectonic attributes. An existing cytoarchitectonic vision foundation model (CytoNet) is then coupled to a large language model via an image-to-text training objective, enabling microscopy regions to be described in natural language. Across 57 brain areas, the resulting method produces plausible area-level descriptions and supports open-set use through explicit rejection of unseen areas. It matches the cytoarchitectonic reference label for in-scope patches with 90.6% accuracy and, with the area label masked, its descriptions remain discriminative enough to recover the area in an 8-way test with 68.6% accuracy. These results suggest that weak, label-mediated pairing can suffice to connect existing biomedical vision foundation models to language, providing a practical recipe for integrating natural-language in domains where fine-grained paired annotations are scarce.

### Align then Adapt: Rethinking Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning in 4D Perception

Point cloud video understanding is critical for robotics as it accurately encodes motion and scene interaction. We recognize that 4D datasets are far scarcer than 3D ones, which hampers the scalability of self-supervised 4D models. A promising alternative is to transfer 3D pre-trained models to 4D perception tasks. However, rigorous empirical analysis reveals two critical limitations that impede transfer capability: overfitting and the modality gap. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel "Align then Adapt" (PointATA) paradigm that decomposes parameter-efficient transfer learning into two sequential stages. Optimal-transport theory is employed to quantify the distributional discrepancy between 3D and 4D datasets, enabling our proposed point align embedder to be trained in Stage 1 to alleviate the underlying modality gap. To mitigate overfitting, an efficient point-video adapter and a spatial-context encoder are integrated into the frozen 3D backbone to enhance temporal modeling capacity in Stage 2. Notably, with the above engineering-oriented designs, PointATA enables a pre-trained 3D model without temporal knowledge to reason about dynamic video content at a smaller parameter cost compared to previous work. Extensive experiments show that PointATA can match or even outperform strong full fine-tuning models, whilst enjoying the advantage of parameter efficiency, e.g. 97.21 \% accuracy on 3D action recognition, $+8.7 \%$ on 4 D action segmentation, and 84.06\% on 4D semantic segmentation.

### GeoWorld: Geometric World Models

Energy-based predictive world models provide a powerful approach for multi-step visual planning by reasoning over latent energy landscapes rather than generating pixels. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: (i) their latent representations are typically learned in Euclidean space, neglecting the underlying geometric and hierarchical structure among states, and (ii) they struggle with long-horizon prediction, which leads to rapid degradation across extended rollouts. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoWorld, a geometric world model that preserves geometric structure and hierarchical relations through a Hyperbolic JEPA, which maps latent representations from Euclidean space onto hyperbolic manifolds. We further introduce Geometric Reinforcement Learning for energy-based optimization, enabling stable multi-step planning in hyperbolic latent space. Extensive experiments on CrossTask and COIN demonstrate around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to the state-of-the-art V-JEPA 2.

### D-FINE-seg: Object Detection and Instance Segmentation Framework with multi-backend deployment

Transformer-based real-time object detectors achieve strong accuracy-latency trade-offs, and D-FINE is among the top-performing recent architectures. However, real-time instance segmentation with transformers is still less common. We present D-FINE-seg, an instance segmentation extension of D-FINE that adds: a lightweight mask head, segmentation-aware training, including box cropped BCE and dice mask losses, auxiliary and denoising mask supervision, and adapted Hungarian matching cost. On the TACO dataset, D-FINE-seg improves F1-score over Ultralytics YOLO26 under a unified TensorRT FP16 end-to-end benchmarking protocol, while maintaining competitive latency. Second contribution is an end-to-end pipeline for training, exporting, and optimized inference across ONNX, TensorRT, OpenVINO for both object detection and instance segmentation tasks. This framework is released as open-source under the Apache-2.0 license. GitHub repository - https://github.com/ArgoHA/D-FINE-seg.

### PackUV: Packed Gaussian UV Maps for 4D Volumetric Video
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23040v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23040v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23040v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23040v1)

Volumetric videos offer immersive 4D experiences, but remain difficult to reconstruct, store, and stream at scale. Existing Gaussian Splatting based methods achieve high-quality reconstruction but break down on long sequences, temporal inconsistency, and fail under large motions and disocclusions. Moreover, their outputs are typically incompatible with conventional video coding pipelines, preventing practical applications.
  We introduce PackUV, a novel 4D Gaussian representation that maps all Gaussian attributes into a sequence of structured, multi-scale UV atlas, enabling compact, image-native storage. To fit this representation from multi-view videos, we propose PackUV-GS, a temporally consistent fitting method that directly optimizes Gaussian parameters in the UV domain. A flow-guided Gaussian labeling and video keyframing module identifies dynamic Gaussians, stabilizes static regions, and preserves temporal coherence even under large motions and disocclusions. The resulting UV atlas format is the first unified volumetric video representation compatible with standard video codecs (e.g., FFV1) without losing quality, enabling efficient streaming within existing multimedia infrastructure.
  To evaluate long-duration volumetric capture, we present PackUV-2B, the largest multi-view video dataset to date, featuring more than 50 synchronized cameras, substantial motion, and frequent disocclusions across 100 sequences and 2B (billion) frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing baselines in rendering fidelity while scaling to sequences up to 30 minutes with consistent quality.

### Small Object Detection Model with Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention and Multi-Scale Features Enhancement in Aerial Images
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23031v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23031v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23031v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23031v1)

Detecting objects in aerial images confronts some significant challenges, including small size, dense and non-uniform distribution of objects over high-resolution images, which makes detection inefficient. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a small object detection algorithm based on a Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention and Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement in aerial images. Firstly, in order to improve the feature representation of ResNet-50 on small objects, we presented a novel Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention (SLPA) module, which is integrated after each stage of ResNet-50 to identify and emphasize important local regions. Secondly, to enhance the model's semantic understanding and features representation, we designed a Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement Module (MSFEM), which is incorporated into the lateral connections of C5 layer for building Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). Finally, the features representation quality of traditional feature pyramid network will be affected because the features are not aligned when the upper and lower layers are fused. In order to handle it, we utilized deformable convolutions to align the features in the fusion processing of the upper and lower levels of the Feature Pyramid Network, which can help enhance the model's ability to detect and recognize small objects. The extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets: VisDrone and DOTA demonstrate that our improved model performs better for small object detection in aerial images compared to the original algorithm.

### WISER: Wider Search, Deeper Thinking, and Adaptive Fusion for Training-Free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23029v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23029v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23029v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23029v1)

2026/02/26 14:11 GTM

Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images given a multimodal query (comprising a reference image and a modification text), without training on annotated triplets. Existing methods typically convert the multimodal query into a single modality-either as an edited caption for Text-to-Image retrieval (T2I) or as an edited image for Image-to-Image retrieval (I2I). However, each paradigm has inherent limitations: T2I often loses fine-grained visual details, while I2I struggles with complex semantic modifications. To effectively leverage their complementary strengths under diverse query intents, we propose WISER, a training-free framework that unifies T2I and I2I via a "retrieve-verify-refine" pipeline, explicitly modeling intent awareness and uncertainty awareness. Specifically, WISER first performs Wider Search by generating both edited captions and images for parallel retrieval to broaden the candidate pool. Then, it conducts Adaptive Fusion with a verifier to assess retrieval confidence, triggering refinement for uncertain retrievals, and dynamically fusing the dual-path for reliable ones. For uncertain retrievals, WISER generates refinement suggestions through structured self-reflection to guide the next retrieval round toward Deeper Thinking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISER significantly outperforms previous methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving relative improvements of 45% on CIRCO (mAP@5) and 57% on CIRR (Recall@1) over existing training-free methods. Notably, it even surpasses many training-dependent methods, highlighting its superiority and generalization under diverse scenarios. Code will be released at https://github.com/Physicsmile/WISER.

### DMAligner: Enhancing Image Alignment via Diffusion Model Based View Synthesis

Image alignment is a fundamental task in computer vision with broad applications. Existing methods predominantly employ optical flow-based image warping. However, this technique is susceptible to common challenges such as occlusions and illumination variations, leading to degraded alignment visual quality and compromised accuracy in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present DMAligner, a diffusion-based framework for image alignment through alignment-oriented view synthesis. DMAligner is crafted to tackle the challenges in image alignment from a new perspective, employing a generation-based solution that showcases strong capabilities and avoids the problems associated with flow-based image warping. Specifically, we propose a Dynamics-aware Diffusion Training approach for learning conditional image generation, synthesizing a novel view for image alignment. This incorporates a Dynamics-aware Mask Producing (DMP) module to adaptively distinguish dynamic foreground regions from static backgrounds, enabling the diffusion model to more effectively handle challenges that classical methods struggle to solve. Furthermore, we develop the Dynamic Scene Image Alignment (DSIA) dataset using Blender, which includes 1,033 indoor and outdoor scenes with over 30K image pairs tailored for image alignment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on DSIA benchmarks, as well as on a series of widely-used video datasets for qualitative comparisons. Our code is available at https://github.com/boomluo02/DMAligner.

### SubspaceAD: Training-Free Few-Shot Anomaly Detection via Subspace Modeling

Detecting visual anomalies in industrial inspection often requires training with only a few normal images per category. Recent few-shot methods achieve strong results employing foundation-model features, but typically rely on memory banks, auxiliary datasets, or multi-modal tuning of vision-language models. We therefore question whether such complexity is necessary given the feature representations of vision foundation models. To answer this question, we introduce SubspaceAD, a training-free method, that operates in two simple stages. First, patch-level features are extracted from a small set of normal images by a frozen DINOv2 backbone. Second, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model is fit to these features to estimate the low-dimensional subspace of normal variations. At inference, anomalies are detected via the reconstruction residual with respect to this subspace, producing interpretable and statistically grounded anomaly scores. Despite its simplicity, SubspaceAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across one-shot and few-shot settings without training, prompt tuning, or memory banks. In the one-shot anomaly detection setting, SubspaceAD achieves image-level and pixel-level AUROC of 98.0% and 97.6% on the MVTec-AD dataset, and 93.3% and 98.3% on the VisA dataset, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art results. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/CLendering/SubspaceAD.

### HELMLAB: An Analytical, Data-Driven Color Space for Perceptual Distance in UI Design Systems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23010v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23010v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23010v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23010v1)

2026/02/26 13:52 GTM

We present HELMLAB, a 72-parameter analytical color space for UI design systems. The forward transform maps CIE XYZ to a perceptually-organized Lab representation through learned matrices, per-channel power compression, Fourier hue correction, and embedded Helmholtz-Kohlrausch lightness adjustment. A post-pipeline neutral correction guarantees that achromatic colors map to a=b=0 (chroma < 10^-6), and a rigid rotation of the chromatic plane improves hue-angle alignment without affecting the distance metric, which is invariant under isometries. On the COMBVD dataset (3,813 color pairs), HELMLAB achieves a STRESS of 23.22, a 20.4% reduction from CIEDE2000 (29.18). Cross-validation on He et al. 2022 and MacAdam 1974 shows competitive cross-dataset performance. The transform is invertible with round-trip errors below 10^-14. Gamut mapping, design-token export, and dark/light mode adaptation utilities are included for use in web and mobile design systems.

### An automatic counting algorithm for the quantification and uncertainty analysis of the number of microglial cells trainable in small and heterogeneous datasets
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22974v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22974v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22974v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22974v1)

Counting immunopositive cells on biological tissues generally requires either manual annotation or (when available) automatic rough systems, for scanning signal surface and intensity in whole slide imaging. In this work, we tackle the problem of counting microglial cells in lumbar spinal cord cross-sections of rats by omitting cell detection and focusing only on the counting task. Manual cell counting is, however, a time-consuming task and additionally entails extensive personnel training. The classic automatic color-based methods roughly inform about the total labeled area and intensity (protein quantification) but do not specifically provide information on cell number. Since the images to be analyzed have a high resolution but a huge amount of pixels contain just noise or artifacts, we first perform a pre-processing generating several filtered images {(providing a tailored, efficient feature extraction)}. Then, we design an automatic kernel counter that is a non-parametric and non-linear method. The proposed scheme can be easily trained in small datasets since, in its basic version, it relies only on one hyper-parameter. However, being non-parametric and non-linear, the proposed algorithm is flexible enough to express all the information contained in rich and heterogeneous datasets as well (providing the maximum overfit if required). Furthermore, the proposed kernel counter also provides uncertainty estimation of the given prediction, and can directly tackle the case of receiving several expert opinions over the same image. Different numerical experiments with artificial and real datasets show very promising results. Related Matlab code is also provided.

### Certified Circuits: Stability Guarantees for Mechanistic Circuits

Understanding how neural networks arrive at their predictions is essential for debugging, auditing, and deployment. Mechanistic interpretability pursues this goal by identifying circuits - minimal subnetworks responsible for specific behaviors. However, existing circuit discovery methods are brittle: circuits depend strongly on the chosen concept dataset and often fail to transfer out-of-distribution, raising doubts whether they capture concept or dataset-specific artifacts. We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept. Code will be released soon!

### UCM: Unifying Camera Control and Memory with Time-aware Positional Encoding Warping for World Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22960v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22960v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22960v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22960v1)

World models based on video generation demonstrate remarkable potential for simulating interactive environments but face persistent difficulties in two key areas: maintaining long-term content consistency when scenes are revisited and enabling precise camera control from user-provided inputs. Existing methods based on explicit 3D reconstruction often compromise flexibility in unbounded scenarios and fine-grained structures. Alternative methods rely directly on previously generated frames without establishing explicit spatial correspondence, thereby constraining controllability and consistency. To address these limitations, we present UCM, a novel framework that unifies long-term memory and precise camera control via a time-aware positional encoding warping mechanism. To reduce computational overhead, we design an efficient dual-stream diffusion transformer for high-fidelity generation. Moreover, we introduce a scalable data curation strategy utilizing point-cloud-based rendering to simulate scene revisiting, facilitating training on over 500K monocular videos. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that UCM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-term scene consistency, while also achieving precise camera controllability in high-fidelity video generation.

### Can Agents Distinguish Visually Hard-to-Separate Diseases in a Zero-Shot Setting? A Pilot Study

The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to increasing interest in agent-based systems. While most prior work in medical imaging concentrates on automating routine clinical workflows, we study an underexplored yet clinically significant setting: distinguishing visually hard-to-separate diseases in a zero-shot setting. We benchmark representative agents on two imaging-only proxy diagnostic tasks, (1) melanoma vs. atypical nevus and (2) pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia, where visual features are highly confounded despite substantial differences in clinical management. We introduce a multi-agent framework based on contrastive adjudication. Experimental results show improved diagnostic performance (an 11-percentage-point gain in accuracy on dermoscopy data) and reduced unsupported claims on qualitative samples, although overall performance remains insufficient for clinical deployment. We acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in human annotations and the absence of clinical context, which further limit the translation to real-world settings. Within this controlled setting, this pilot study provides preliminary insights into zero-shot agent performance in visually confounded scenarios.

### MM-NeuroOnco: A Multimodal Benchmark and Instruction Dataset for MRI-Based Brain Tumor Diagnosis

Accurate brain tumor diagnosis requires models to not only detect lesions but also generate clinically interpretable reasoning grounded in imaging manifestations, yet existing public datasets remain limited in annotation richness and diagnostic semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-NeuroOnco, a large-scale multimodal benchmark and instruction-tuning dataset for brain tumor MRI understanding, consisting of 24,726 MRI slices from 20 data sources paired with approximately 200,000 semantically enriched multimodal instructions spanning diverse tumor subtypes and imaging modalities. To mitigate the scarcity and high cost of diagnostic semantic annotations, we develop a multi-model collaborative pipeline for automated medical information completion and quality control, enabling the generation of diagnosis-related semantics beyond mask-only annotations. Building upon this dataset, we further construct MM-NeuroOnco-Bench, a manually annotated evaluation benchmark with a rejection-aware setting to reduce biases inherent in closed-ended question formats. Evaluation across ten representative models shows that even the strongest baseline, Gemini 3 Flash, achieves only 41.88% accuracy on diagnosis-related questions, highlighting the substantial challenges of multimodal brain tumor diagnostic understanding. Leveraging MM-NeuroOnco, we further propose NeuroOnco-GPT, which achieves a 27% absolute accuracy improvement on diagnostic questions following fine-tuning. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our dataset and benchmark in advancing clinically grounded multimodal diagnostic reasoning.

### OpenFS: Multi-Hand-Capable Fingerspelling Recognition with Implicit Signing-Hand Detection and Frame-Wise Letter-Conditioned Synthesis

Fingerspelling is a component of sign languages in which words are spelled out letter by letter using specific hand poses. Automatic fingerspelling recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities, yet it remains challenging due to the signing-hand ambiguity issue, the lack of appropriate training losses, and the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Prior fingerspelling recognition methods rely on explicit signing-hand detection, which often leads to recognition failures, and on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss, which exhibits the peaky behavior problem. To address these issues, we develop OpenFS, an open-source approach for fingerspelling recognition and synthesis. We propose a multi-hand-capable fingerspelling recognizer that supports both single- and multi-hand inputs and performs implicit signing-hand detection by incorporating a dual-level positional encoding and a signing-hand focus (SF) loss. The SF loss encourages cross-attention to focus on the signing hand, enabling implicit signing-hand detection during recognition. Furthermore, without relying on the CTC loss, we introduce a monotonic alignment (MA) loss that enforces the output letter sequence to follow the temporal order of the input pose sequence through cross-attention regularization. In addition, we propose a frame-wise letter-conditioned generator that synthesizes realistic fingerspelling pose sequences for OOV words. This generator enables the construction of a new synthetic benchmark, called FSNeo. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in recognition and validate the effectiveness of the proposed recognizer and generator. Codes and data are available in: https://github.com/JunukCha/OpenFS.

### ToProVAR: Efficient Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Tri-Dimensional Entropy-Aware Semantic Analysis and Sparsity Optimization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22948v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22948v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22948v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22948v1)

Visual Autoregressive(VAR) models enhance generation quality but face a critical efficiency bottleneck in later stages. In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework for VAR models that fundamentally differs from prior approaches such as FastVAR and SkipVAR. Instead of relying on heuristic skipping strategies, our method leverages attention entropy to characterize the semantic projections across different dimensions of the model architecture. This enables precise identification of parameter dynamics under varying token granularity levels, semantic scopes, and generation scales. Building on this analysis, we further uncover sparsity patterns along three critical dimensions-token, layer, and scale-and propose a set of fine-grained optimization strategies tailored to these patterns. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves aggressive acceleration of the generation process while significantly preserving semantic fidelity and fine details, outperforming traditional methods in both efficiency and quality. Experiments on Infinity-2B and Infinity-8B models demonstrate that ToProVAR achieves up to 3.4x acceleration with minimal quality loss, effectively mitigating the issues found in prior work. Our code will be made publicly available.

Pacing strategies, defined by velocity and stroke rate profiles, are essential for peak performance in canoe sprint. While GPS is the gold standard for analysis, its limited availability necessitates automated video-based solutions. This paper presents an extended framework for reconstructing performance metrics from panned and zoomed video recordings across all sprint disciplines (K1-K4, C1-C2) and distances (200m-500m). Our method utilizes YOLOv8 for buoy and athlete detection, leveraging the known buoy grid to estimate homographies. We generalized the estimation of the boat position by means of learning a boat-specific athlete offset using a U-net based boat tip calibration. Further, we implement a robust tracking scheme using optical flow to adapt to multi-athlete boat types. Finally, we introduce methods to extract stroke rate information from either pose estimations or the athlete bounding boxes themselves. Evaluation against GPS data from elite competitions yields a velocity RRMSE of 0.020 +- 0.011 (rho = 0.956) and a stroke rate RRMSE of 0.022 +- 0.024 (rho = 0.932). The methods provide coaches with highly accurate, automated feedback without requiring on-boat sensors or manual annotation.

### pMoE: Prompting Diverse Experts Together Wins More in Visual Adaptation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22938v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22938v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22938v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22938v1)

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has demonstrated promising results across various visual adaptation tasks, such as classification and segmentation. Typically, prompt tuning techniques have harnessed knowledge from a single pre-trained model, whether from a general or a specialized medical domain. However, this approach typically overlooks the potential synergies that could arise from integrating diverse domain knowledge within the same tuning process. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts prompt tuning method called pMoE, which leverages the strengths of multiple expert domains through expert-specialized prompt tokens and the learnable dispatcher, effectively combining their expertise in a unified model framework. Our pMoE introduces expert-specific prompt tokens and utilizes a dynamic token dispatching mechanism at various prompt layers to optimize the contribution of each domain expert during the adaptation phase. By incorporating both domain knowledge from diverse experts, the proposed pMoE significantly enhances the model's versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across 47 adaptation tasks, including both classification and segmentation in general and medical domains. The results demonstrate that our pMoE not only achieves superior performance with a large margin of improvements but also offers an optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and adaptation effectiveness compared to existing methods.

### MSJoE: Jointly Evolving MLLM and Sampler for Efficient Long-Form Video Understanding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22932v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22932v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22932v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22932v1)

Efficiently understanding long-form videos remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this paper, we present MLLM-Sampler Joint Evolution (MSJoE), a novel framework that jointly evolves the MLLM and a lightweight key-frame sampler for efficient long-form video understanding. MSJoE builds upon a key assumption that only a small subset of key-frames is truly informative for answering each question to a video. Specifically, MSJoE first reasons out several queries, which describe diverse visual perspectives relevant to the question. Then, these queries interact with a frozen CLIP model to produce a query-frame similarity matrix. Finally, a lightweight sampler predicts key-frame sampling weights from this matrix, selecting a compact set of informative frames, which are then fed into the MLLM for answer generation. Both the MLLM and sampler are jointly optimized through reinforcement learning, enabling co-adaptation of query-reasoning, frame-sampling, and key-frame understanding. A new long-video QA dataset containing 2.8K videos with 7K question-answer pairs is collected to support the training process. Extensive experiments on VideoMME, LongVideoBench, LVBench, and MLVU show that MSJoE achieves 8.0\% accuracy gain upon the base MLLM, and 1.1\% higher accuracy than strongest baseline method.

While autonomous navigation has achieved remarkable success in passive perception (e.g., object detection and segmentation), it remains fundamentally constrained by a void in knowledge-driven, interactive environmental cognition. In the high-stakes domain of maritime navigation, the ability to bridge the gap between raw visual perception and complex cognitive reasoning is not merely an enhancement but a critical prerequisite for Autonomous Surface Vessels to execute safe and precise maneuvers. To this end, we present WaterVideoQA, the first large-scale, comprehensive Video Question Answering benchmark specifically engineered for all-waterway environments. This benchmark encompasses 3,029 video clips across six distinct waterway categories, integrating multifaceted variables such as volatile lighting and dynamic weather to rigorously stress-test ASV capabilities across a five-tier hierarchical cognitive framework. Furthermore, we introduce NaviMind, a pioneering multi-agent neuro-symbolic system designed for open-ended maritime reasoning. By synergizing Adaptive Semantic Routing, Situation-Aware Hierarchical Reasoning, and Autonomous Self-Reflective Verification, NaviMind transitions ASVs from superficial pattern matching to regulation-compliant, interpretable decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly transcends existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for intelligent, trustworthy interaction in dynamic maritime environments.

### OSDaR-AR: Enhancing Railway Perception Datasets via Multi-modal Augmented Reality

Although deep learning has significantly advanced the perception capabilities of intelligent transportation systems, railway applications continue to suffer from a scarcity of high-quality, annotated data for safety-critical tasks like obstacle detection. While photorealistic simulators offer a solution, they often struggle with the ``sim-to-real" gap; conversely, simple image-masking techniques lack the spatio-temporal coherence required to obtain augmented single- and multi-frame scenes with the correct appearance and dimensions. This paper introduces a multi-modal augmented reality framework designed to bridge this gap by integrating photorealistic virtual objects into real-world railway sequences from the OSDaR23 dataset. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5 features, our pipeline leverages LiDAR point-clouds and INS/GNSS data to ensure accurate object placement and temporal stability across RGB frames. This paper also proposes a segmentation-based refinement strategy for INS/GNSS data to significantly improve the realism of the augmented sequences, as confirmed by the comparative study presented in the paper. Carefully designed augmented sequences are collected to produce OSDaR-AR, a public dataset designed to support the development of next-generation railway perception systems. The dataset is available at the following page: https://syndra.retis.santannapisa.it/osdarar.html

### Chain of Flow: A Foundational Generative Framework for ECG-to-4D Cardiac Digital Twins

A clinically actionable Cardiac Digital Twin (CDT) should reconstruct individualised cardiac anatomy and physiology, update its internal state from multimodal signals, and enable a broad range of downstream simulations beyond isolated tasks. However, existing CDT frameworks remain limited to task-specific predictors rather than building a patient-specific, manipulable virtual heart. In this work, we introduce Chain of Flow (COF), a foundational ECG-driven generative framework that reconstructs full 4D cardiac structure and motion from a single cardiac cycle. The method integrates cine-CMR and 12-lead ECG during training to learn a unified representation of cardiac geometry, electrophysiology, and motion dynamics. We evaluate Chain of Flow on diverse cohorts and demonstrate accurate recovery of cardiac anatomy, chamber-wise function, and dynamic motion patterns. The reconstructed 4D hearts further support downstream CDT tasks such as volumetry, regional function analysis, and virtual cine synthesis. By enabling full 4D organ reconstruction directly from ECG, COF transforms cardiac digital twins from narrow predictive models into fully generative, patient-specific virtual hearts. Code will be released after review.

### Towards Multimodal Domain Generalization with Few Labels

Multimodal models ideally should generalize to unseen domains while remaining data-efficient to reduce annotation costs. To this end, we introduce and study a new problem, Semi-Supervised Multimodal Domain Generalization (SSMDG), which aims to learn robust multimodal models from multi-source data with few labeled samples. We observe that existing approaches fail to address this setting effectively: multimodal domain generalization methods cannot exploit unlabeled data, semi-supervised multimodal learning methods ignore domain shifts, and semi-supervised domain generalization methods are confined to single-modality inputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework featuring three key components: Consensus-Driven Consistency Regularization, which obtains reliable pseudo-labels through confident fused-unimodal consensus; Disagreement-Aware Regularization, which effectively utilizes ambiguous non-consensus samples; and Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment, which enforces domain- and modality-invariant representations while promoting robustness under missing modalities via cross-modal translation. We further establish the first SSMDG benchmarks, on which our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in both standard and missing-modality scenarios. Our benchmarks and code are available at https://github.com/lihongzhao99/SSMDG.

### OmniGAIA: Towards Native Omni-Modal AI Agents

Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.

### SO3UFormer: Learning Intrinsic Spherical Features for Rotation-Robust Panoramic Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22867v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22867v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22867v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22867v1)

Panoramic semantic segmentation models are typically trained under a strict gravity-aligned assumption. However, real-world captures often deviate from this canonical orientation due to unconstrained camera motions, such as the rotational jitter of handheld devices or the dynamic attitude shifts of aerial platforms. This discrepancy causes standard spherical Transformers to overfit global latitude cues, leading to performance collapse under 3D reorientations. To address this, we introduce SO3UFormer, a rotation-robust architecture designed to learn intrinsic spherical features that are less sensitive to the underlying coordinate frame. Our approach rests on three geometric pillars: (1) an intrinsic feature formulation that decouples the representation from the gravity vector by removing absolute latitude encoding; (2) quadrature-consistent spherical attention that accounts for non-uniform sampling densities; and (3) a gauge-aware relative positional mechanism that encodes local angular geometry using tangent-plane projected angles and discrete gauge pooling, avoiding reliance on global axes. We further use index-based spherical resampling together with a logit-level SO(3)-consistency regularizer during training. To rigorously benchmark robustness, we introduce Pose35, a dataset variant of Stanford2D3D perturbed by random rotations within $\pm 35^\circ$. Under the extreme test of arbitrary full SO(3) rotations, existing SOTAs fail catastrophically: the baseline SphereUFormer drops from 67.53 mIoU to 25.26 mIoU. In contrast, SO3UFormer demonstrates remarkable stability, achieving 72.03 mIoU on Pose35 and retaining 70.67 mIoU under full SO(3) rotations.

### GraspLDP: Towards Generalizable Grasping Policy via Latent Diffusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22862v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22862v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22862v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22862v1)

This paper focuses on enhancing the grasping precision and generalization of manipulation policies learned via imitation learning. Diffusion-based policy learning methods have recently become the mainstream approach for robotic manipulation tasks. As grasping is a critical subtask in manipulation, the ability of imitation-learned policies to execute precise and generalizable grasps merits particular attention. Existing imitation learning techniques for grasping often suffer from imprecise grasp executions, limited spatial generalization, and poor object generalization. To address these challenges, we incorporate grasp prior knowledge into the diffusion policy framework. In particular, we employ a latent diffusion policy to guide action chunk decoding with grasp pose prior, ensuring that generated motion trajectories adhere closely to feasible grasp configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised reconstruction objective during diffusion to embed the graspness prior: at each reverse diffusion step, we reconstruct wrist-camera images back-projected the graspness from the intermediate representations. Both simulation and real robot experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods and exhibits strong dynamic grasping capabilities.

### From Blind Spots to Gains: Diagnostic-Driven Iterative Training for Large Multimodal Models

As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) scale up and reinforcement learning (RL) methods mature, LMMs have made notable progress in complex reasoning and decision making. Yet training still relies on static data and fixed recipes, making it difficult to diagnose capability blind spots or provide dynamic, targeted reinforcement. Motivated by findings that test driven error exposure and feedback based correction outperform repetitive practice, we propose Diagnostic-driven Progressive Evolution (DPE), a spiral loop where diagnosis steers data generation and reinforcement, and each iteration re-diagnoses the updated model to drive the next round of targeted improvement. DPE has two key components. First, multiple agents annotate and quality control massive unlabeled multimodal data, using tools such as web search and image editing to produce diverse, realistic samples. Second, DPE attributes failures to specific weaknesses, dynamically adjusts the data mixture, and guides agents to generate weakness focused data for targeted reinforcement. Experiments on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct show stable, continual gains across eleven benchmarks, indicating DPE as a scalable paradigm for continual LMM training under open task distributions. Our code, models, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/hongruijia/DPE.

### A data- and compute-efficient chest X-ray foundation model beyond aggressive scaling

Foundation models for medical imaging are typically pretrained on increasingly large datasets, following a "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. However, this strategy faces two critical challenges: large-scale medical datasets often contain substantial redundancy and severe class imbalance that bias representation learning toward over-represented patterns, and indiscriminate training regardless of heterogeneity in data quality incurs considerable computational inefficiency. Here we demonstrate that active, principled data curation during pretraining can serve as a viable, cost-effective alternative to brute-force dataset enlargement. We introduce CheXficient, a chest X-ray (CXR) foundation model that selectively prioritizes informative training samples. CheXficient is pretrained on only 22.7% of 1,235,004 paired CXR images and reports while consuming under 27.3% of the total compute budget, yet achieving comparable or superior performance to its full-data counterpart and other large-scale pretrained models. We assess CheXficient across 20 individual benchmarks spanning 5 task types, including non-adapted off-the-shelf evaluations (zero-shot findings classification and crossmodal retrieval) and adapted downstream tasks (disease prediction, semantic segmentation, and radiology report generation). Further analyses show that CheXficient systematically prioritizes under-represented training samples, improving generalizability on long-tailed or rare conditions. Overall, our work offers practical insights into the data and computation demands for efficient pretraining and downstream adaptation of medical vision-language foundation models.

### Moral Preferences of LLMs Under Directed Contextual Influence

Moral benchmarks for LLMs typically use context-free prompts, implicitly assuming stable preferences. In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior.

### Reflectance Multispectral Imaging for Soil Composition Estimation and USDA Texture Classification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22829v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22829v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22829v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22829v1)

Soil texture is a foundational attribute that governs water availability and erosion in agriculture, as well as load bearing capacity, deformation response, and shrink-swell risk in geotechnical engineering. Yet texture is still typically determined by slow and labour intensive laboratory particle size tests, while many sensing alternatives are either costly or too coarse to support routine field scale deployment. This paper proposes a robust and field deployable multispectral imaging (MSI) system and machine learning framework for predicting soil composition and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) texture classes. The proposed system uses a cost effective in-house MSI device operating from 365 nm to 940 nm to capture thirteen spectral bands, which effectively capture the spectral properties of soil texture. Regression models use the captured spectral properties to estimate clay, silt, and sand percentages, while a direct classifier predicts one of the twelve USDA textural classes. Indirect classification is obtained by mapping the regressed compositions to texture classes via the USDA soil texture triangle. The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a coefficient of determination R^2 up to 0.99 for composition prediction and over 99% accuracy for texture classification. These findings indicate that MSI combined with data-driven modeling can provide accurate, non-destructive, and field deployable soil texture characterization suitable for geotechnical screening and precision agriculture.

### CMSA-Net: Causal Multi-scale Aggregation with Adaptive Multi-source Reference for Video Polyp Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22821v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22821v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22821v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22821v1)

Video polyp segmentation (VPS) is an important task in computer-aided colonoscopy, as it helps doctors accurately locate and track polyps during examinations. However, VPS remains challenging because polyps often look similar to surrounding mucosa, leading to weak semantic discrimination. In addition, large changes in polyp position and scale across video frames make stable and accurate segmentation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a robust VPS framework named CMSA-Net. The proposed network introduces a Causal Multi-scale Aggregation (CMA) module to effectively gather semantic information from multiple historical frames at different scales. By using causal attention, CMA ensures that temporal feature propagation follows strict time order, which helps reduce noise and improve feature reliability. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Multi-source Reference (DMR) strategy that adaptively selects informative and reliable reference frames based on semantic separability and prediction confidence. This strategy provides strong multi-frame guidance while keeping the model efficient for real-time inference. Extensive experiments on the SUN-SEG dataset demonstrate that CMSA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a favorable balance between segmentation accuracy and real-time clinical applicability.

### Face Time Traveller : Travel Through Ages Without Losing Identity
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22819v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22819v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22819v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22819v1)

Face aging, an ill-posed problem shaped by environmental and genetic factors, is vital in entertainment, forensics, and digital archiving, where realistic age transformations must preserve both identity and visual realism. However, existing works relying on numerical age representations overlook the interplay of biological and contextual cues. Despite progress in recent face aging models, they struggle with identity preservation in wide age transformations, also static attention and optimization-heavy inversion in diffusion limit adaptability, fine-grained control and background consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Face Time Traveller (FaceTT), a diffusion-based framework that achieves high-fidelity, identity-consistent age transformation. Here, we introduce a Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement strategy that encodes intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental) aging cues for context-aware conditioning. A tuning-free Angular Inversion method is proposed that efficiently maps real faces into the diffusion latent space for fast and accurate reconstruction. Moreover, an Adaptive Attention Control mechanism is introduced that dynamically balances cross-attention for semantic aging cues and self-attention for structural and identity preservation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and in-the-wild testset demonstrate that FaceTT achieves superior identity retention, background preservation and aging realism over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

### PhotoAgent: Agentic Photo Editing with Exploratory Visual Aesthetic Planning

With the recent fast development of generative models, instruction-based image editing has shown great potential in generating high-quality images. However, the quality of editing highly depends on carefully designed instructions, placing the burden of task decomposition and sequencing entirely on the user. To achieve autonomous image editing, we present PhotoAgent, a system that advances image editing through explicit aesthetic planning. Specifically, PhotoAgent formulates autonomous image editing as a long-horizon decision-making problem. It reasons over user aesthetic intent, plans multi-step editing actions via tree search, and iteratively refines results through closed-loop execution with memory and visual feedback, without requiring step-by-step user prompts. To support reliable evaluation in real-world scenarios, we introduce UGC-Edit, an aesthetic evaluation benchmark consisting of 7,000 photos and a learned aesthetic reward model. We also construct a test set containing 1,017 photos to systematically assess autonomous photo editing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhotoAgent consistently improves both instruction adherence and visual quality compared with baseline methods.

### GSTurb: Gaussian Splatting for Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation

Atmospheric turbulence causes significant image degradation due to pixel displacement (tilt) and blur, particularly in long-range imaging applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for atmospheric turbulence mitigation, GSTurb, which integrates optical flow-guided tilt correction and Gaussian splatting for modeling non-isoplanatic blur. The framework employs Gaussian parameters to represent tilt and blur, and optimizes them across multiple frames to enhance restoration. Experimental results on the ATSyn-static dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a peak PSNR of 27.67 dB and SSIM of 0.8735. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, GSTurb improves PSNR by 1.3 dB (a 4.5% increase) and SSIM by 0.048 (a 5.8% increase). Additionally, on real datasets, including the TSRWGAN Real-World and CLEAR datasets, GSTurb outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance. These results highlight that combining optical flow-guided tilt correction with Gaussian splatting effectively enhances image restoration under both synthetic and real-world turbulence conditions. The code for this method will be available at https://github.com/DuhlLiamz/3DGS_turbulence/tree/main.

### Robust Human Trajectory Prediction via Self-Supervised Skeleton Representation Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22791v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22791v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22791v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22791v1)

Human trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in applications such as autonomous navigation and video surveillance. While recent works have explored the integration of human skeleton sequences to complement trajectory information, skeleton data in real-world environments often suffer from missing joints caused by occlusions. These disturbances significantly degrade prediction accuracy, indicating the need for more robust skeleton representations. We propose a robust trajectory prediction method that incorporates a self-supervised skeleton representation model pretrained with masked autoencoding. Experimental results in occlusion-prone scenarios show that our method improves robustness to missing skeletal data without sacrificing prediction accuracy, and consistently outperforms baseline models in clean-to-moderate missingness regimes.

### SceneTransporter: Optimal Transport-Guided Compositional Latent Diffusion for Single-Image Structured 3D Scene Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22785v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22785v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22785v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22785v1)

2026/02/26 09:19 GTM

We introduce SceneTransporter, an end-to-end framework for structured 3D scene generation from a single image. While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement. Second, the competitive nature of the transport encourages the grouping of similar patches, a process that is further regularized by an edge-based cost, to form coherent objects and prevent fragmentation. Extensive experiments show that SceneTransporter outperforms existing methods on open-world scene generation, significantly improving instance-level coherence and geometric fidelity. Code and models will be publicly available at https://2019epwl.github.io/SceneTransporter/.

### TrajTok: Learning Trajectory Tokens enables better Video Understanding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22779v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22779v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22779v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22779v1)

2026/02/26 09:15 GTM

Tokenization in video models, typically through patchification, generates an excessive and redundant number of tokens. This severely limits video efficiency and scalability. While recent trajectory-based tokenizers offer a promising solution by decoupling video duration from token count, they rely on complex external segmentation and tracking pipelines that are slow and task-agnostic. We propose TrajTok, an end-to-end video tokenizer module that is fully integrated and co-trained with video models for a downstream objective, dynamically adapting its token granularity to semantic complexity, independent of video duration. TrajTok contains a unified segmenter that performs implicit clustering over pixels in both space and time to directly produce object trajectories in a single forward pass. By prioritizing downstream adaptability over pixel-perfect segmentation fidelity, TrajTok is lightweight and efficient, yet empirically improves video understanding performance. With TrajTok, we implement a video CLIP model trained from scratch (TrajViT2). It achieves the best accuracy at scale across both classification and retrieval benchmarks, while maintaining efficiency comparable to the best token-merging methods. TrajTok also proves to be a versatile component beyond its role as a tokenizer. We show that it can be seamlessly integrated as either a probing head for pretrained visual features (TrajAdapter) or an alignment connector in vision-language models (TrajVLM) with especially strong performance in long-video reasoning.

### Beyond Detection: Multi-Scale Hidden-Code for Natural Image Deepfake Recovery and Factual Retrieval
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22759v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22759v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22759v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22759v1)

2026/02/26 08:47 GTM

Recent advances in image authenticity have primarily focused on deepfake detection and localization, leaving recovery of tampered contents for factual retrieval relatively underexplored. We propose a unified hidden-code recovery framework that enables both retrieval and restoration from post-hoc and in-generation watermarking paradigms. Our method encodes semantic and perceptual information into a compact hidden-code representation, refined through multi-scale vector quantization, and enhances contextual reasoning via conditional Transformer modules. To enable systematic evaluation for natural images, we construct ImageNet-S, a benchmark that provides paired image-label factual retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-S demonstrate that our method exhibits promising retrieval and reconstruction performance while remaining fully compatible with diverse watermarking pipelines. This framework establishes a foundation for general-purpose image recovery beyond detection and localization.

### SPATIALALIGN: Aligning Dynamic Spatial Relationships in Video Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22745v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22745v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22745v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22745v1)

2026/02/26 08:34 GTM

Most text-to-video (T2V) generators prioritize aesthetic quality, but often ignoring the spatial constraints in the generated videos. In this work, we present SPATIALALIGN, a self-improvement framework that enhances T2V models capabilities to depict Dynamic Spatial Relationships (DSR) specified in text prompts. We present a zeroth-order regularized Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune T2V models towards better alignment with DSR. Specifically, we design DSR-SCORE, a geometry-based metric that quantitatively measures the alignment between generated videos and the specified DSRs in prompts, which is a step forward from prior works that rely on VLM for evaluation. We also conduct a dataset of text-video pairs with diverse DSRs to facilitate the study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned model significantly out performs the baseline in spatial relationships. The code will be released in Link.

### ProjFlow: Projection Sampling with Flow Matching for Zero-Shot Exact Spatial Motion Control
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22742v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22742v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22742v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22742v1)

2026/02/26 08:29 GTM

Generating human motion with precise spatial control is a challenging problem. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or slow optimization, and enforcing hard constraints frequently disrupts motion naturalness. Building on the observation that many animation tasks can be formulated as a linear inverse problem, we introduce ProjFlow, a training-free sampler that achieves zero-shot, exact satisfaction of linear spatial constraints while preserving motion realism. Our key advance is a novel kinematics-aware metric that encodes skeletal topology. This metric allows the sampler to enforce hard constraints by distributing corrections coherently across the entire skeleton, avoiding the unnatural artifacts of naive projection. Furthermore, for sparse inputs, such as filling in long gaps between a few keyframes, we introduce a time-varying formulation using pseudo-observations that fade during sampling. Extensive experiments on representative applications, motion inpainting, and 2D-to-3D lifting, demonstrate that ProjFlow achieves exact constraint satisfaction and matches or improves realism over zero-shot baselines, while remaining competitive with training-based controllers.

### AMLRIS: Alignment-aware Masked Learning for Referring Image Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22740v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22740v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22740v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22740v1)

2026/02/26 08:29 GTM

Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment an object in an image identified by a natural language expression. The paper introduces Alignment-Aware Masked Learning (AML), a training strategy to enhance RIS by explicitly estimating pixel-level vision-language alignment, filtering out poorly aligned regions during optimization, and focusing on trustworthy cues. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO datasets and also enhances robustness to diverse descriptions and scenarios

### Asymmetric Idiosyncrasies in Multimodal Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22734v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22734v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22734v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22734v1)

2026/02/26 08:16 GTM

In this work, we study idiosyncrasies in the caption models and their downstream impact on text-to-image models. We design a systematic analysis: given either a generated caption or the corresponding image, we train neural networks to predict the originating caption model. Our results show that text classification yields very high accuracy (99.70\%), indicating that captioning models embed distinctive stylistic signatures. In contrast, these signatures largely disappear in the generated images, with classification accuracy dropping to at most 50\% even for the state-of-the-art Flux model. To better understand this cross-modal discrepancy, we further analyze the data and find that the generated images fail to preserve key variations present in captions, such as differences in the level of detail, emphasis on color and texture, and the distribution of objects within a scene. Overall, our classification-based framework provides a novel methodology for quantifying both the stylistic idiosyncrasies of caption models and the prompt-following ability of text-to-image systems.

### Sapling-NeRF: Geo-Localised Sapling Reconstruction in Forests for Ecological Monitoring
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22731v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22731v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22731v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22731v1)

2026/02/26 08:13 GTM

Saplings are key indicators of forest regeneration and overall forest health. However, their fine-scale architectural traits are difficult to capture with existing 3D sensing methods, which make quantitative evaluation difficult. Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS), Mobile Laser Scanners (MLS), or traditional photogrammetry approaches poorly reconstruct thin branches, dense foliage, and lack the scale consistency needed for long-term monitoring. Implicit 3D reconstruction methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are promising alternatives, but cannot recover the true scale of a scene and lack any means to be accurately geo-localised. In this paper, we present a pipeline which fuses NeRF, LiDAR SLAM, and GNSS to enable repeatable, geo-localised ecological monitoring of saplings. Our system proposes a three-level representation: (i) coarse Earth-frame localisation using GNSS, (ii) LiDAR-based SLAM for centimetre-accurate localisation and reconstruction, and (iii) NeRF-derived object-centric dense reconstruction of individual saplings. This approach enables repeatable quantitative evaluation and long-term monitoring of sapling traits. Our experiments in forest plots in Wytham Woods (Oxford, UK) and Evo (Finland) show that stem height, branching patterns, and leaf-to-wood ratios can be captured with increased accuracy as compared to TLS. We demonstrate that accurate stem skeletons and leaf distributions can be measured for saplings with heights between 0.5m and 2m in situ, giving ecologists access to richer structural and quantitative data for analysing forest dynamics.

### HulluEdit: Single-Pass Evidence-Consistent Subspace Editing for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22727v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22727v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22727v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22727v1)

2026/02/26 08:08 GTM

Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly hinders their reliable deployment. Existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy: they often require expensive reference models and multiple forward passes, or apply static edits that risk suppressing genuine visual evidence. To address this, we introduce HulluEdit, a single-pass, reference-free intervention framework. Our core innovation is orthogonal subspace editing: we decompose the hidden states of the model into orthogonal subspaces - visual evidence, conflicting priors, and residual uncertainty - enabling selective suppression of hallucinatory patterns without interfering with visual grounding. This approach mathematically guarantees that edits applied to the prior subspace leave the visual component entirely unaffected. Extensive experiments show that HulluEdit achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction on benchmarks including POPE and CHAIR across diverse architectures, while preserving general capabilities on MME and maintaining efficient inference. Our method consistently outperforms contrastive decoding and static subspace editing baselines, offering a new pathway toward more trustworthy LVLMs.

### IRSDE-Despeckle: A Physics-Grounded Diffusion Model for Generalizable Ultrasound Despeckling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22717v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22717v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22717v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22717v1)

2026/02/26 07:42 GTM

Ultrasound imaging is widely used for real-time, noninvasive diagnosis, but speckle and related artifacts reduce image quality and can hinder interpretation. We present a diffusion-based ultrasound despeckling method built on the Image Restoration Stochastic Differential Equations framework. To enable supervised training, we curate large paired datasets by simulating ultrasound images from speckle-free magnetic resonance images using the Matlab UltraSound Toolbox. The proposed model reconstructs speckle-suppressed images while preserving anatomically meaningful edges and contrast. On a held-out simulated test set, our approach consistently outperforms classical filters and recent learning-based despeckling baselines. We quantify prediction uncertainty via cross-model variance and show that higher uncertainty correlates with higher reconstruction error, providing a practical indicator of difficult or failure-prone regions. Finally, we evaluate sensitivity to simulation probe settings and observe domain shift, motivating diversified training and adaptation for robust clinical deployment.

### SoPE: Spherical Coordinate-Based Positional Embedding for Enhancing Spatial Perception of 3D LVLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22716v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22716v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22716v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22716v1)

2026/02/26 07:42 GTM

3D Large Vision-Language Models (3D LVLMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various multimodal tasks. However, their inherited position-dependent modeling mechanism, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), remains suboptimal for 3D multimodal understanding. The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale frequency mixing strategy to fuse feature information across different frequency domains. Experimental results on multiple 3D scene benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, while real-world deployment experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization capability.

### UFO-DETR: Frequency-Guided End-to-End Detector for UAV Tiny Objects

Small target detection in UAV imagery faces significant challenges such as scale variations, dense distribution, and the dominance of small targets. Existing algorithms rely on manually designed components, and general-purpose detectors are not optimized for UAV images, making it difficult to balance accuracy and complexity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an end-to-end object detection framework, UFO-DETR, which integrates an LSKNet-based backbone network to optimize the receptive field and reduce the number of parameters. By combining the DAttention and AIFI modules, the model flexibly models multi-scale spatial relationships, improving multi-scale target detection performance. Additionally, the DynFreq-C3 module is proposed to enhance small target detection capability through cross-space frequency feature enhancement. Experimental results show that, compared to RT-DETR-L, the proposed method offers significant advantages in both detection performance and computational efficiency, providing an efficient solution for UAV edge computing.

### GFRRN: Explore the Gaps in Single Image Reflection Removal
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22695v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22695v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22695v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22695v1)

Prior dual-stream methods with the feature interaction mechanism have achieved remarkable performance in single image reflection removal (SIRR). However, they often struggle with (1) semantic understanding gap between the features of pre-trained models and those of reflection removal models, and (2) reflection label inconsistencies between synthetic and real-world training data. In this work, we first adopt the parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy by integrating several learnable Mona layers into the pre-trained model to align the training directions. Then, a label generator is designed to unify the reflection labels for both synthetic and real-world data. In addition, a Gaussian-based Adaptive Frequency Learning Block (G-AFLB) is proposed to adaptively learn and fuse the frequency priors, and a Dynamic Agent Attention (DAA) is employed as an alternative to window-based attention by dynamically modeling the significance levels across windows (inter-) and within an individual window (intra-). These components constitute our proposed Gap-Free Reflection Removal Network (GFRRN). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our GFRRN, achieving superior performance against state-of-the-art SIRR methods.

### No Caption, No Problem: Caption-Free Membership Inference via Model-Fitted Embeddings
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22689v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22689v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22689v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22689v1)

Latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity text-to-image generation, but their tendency to memorize training data raises critical privacy and intellectual property concerns. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled way to audit such memorization by determining whether a given sample was included in training. However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image. This embedding amplifies conditional loss responses for member samples while leaving hold-outs relatively less affected, thereby enhancing separability in the absence of ground-truth captions. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that MoFit consistently outperforms prior VLM-conditioned baselines and achieves performance competitive with caption-dependent methods.

### SUPERGLASSES: Benchmarking Vision Language Models as Intelligent Agents for AI Smart Glasses
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22683v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22683v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22683v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22683v1)

2026/02/26 06:55 GTM

The rapid advancement of AI-powered smart glasses, one of the hottest wearable devices, has unlocked new frontiers for multimodal interaction, with Visual Question Answering (VQA) over external knowledge sources emerging as a core application. Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) adapted to smart glasses are typically trained and evaluated on traditional multimodal datasets; however, these datasets lack the variety and realism needed to reflect smart glasses usage scenarios and diverge from their specific challenges, where accurately identifying the object of interest must precede any external knowledge retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce SUPERGLASSES, the first comprehensive VQA benchmark built on real-world data entirely collected by smart glasses devices. SUPERGLASSES comprises 2,422 egocentric image-question pairs spanning 14 image domains and 8 query categories, enriched with full search trajectories and reasoning annotations. We evaluate 26 representative VLMs on this benchmark, revealing significant performance gaps. To address the limitations of existing models, we further propose SUPERLENS, a multimodal smart glasses agent that enables retrieval-augmented answer generation by integrating automatic object detection, query decoupling, and multimodal web search. Our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT-4o by 2.19 percent, and highlights the need for task-specific solutions in smart glasses VQA scenarios.

### ViCLIP-OT: The First Foundation Vision-Language Model for Vietnamese Image-Text Retrieval with Optimal Transport
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22678v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22678v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22678v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22678v1)

2026/02/26 06:51 GTM

Image-text retrieval has become a fundamental component in intelligent multimedia systems; however, most existing vision-language models are optimized for highresource languages and remain suboptimal for low-resource settings such as Vietnamese. This work introduces ViCLIP-OT, a foundation vision-language model specifically designed for Vietnamese image-text retrieval. The proposed framework integrates CLIP-style contrastive learning with a Similarity-Graph Regularized Optimal Transport (SIGROT) loss to enhance global cross-modal consistency and mitigate modality gap issues. Extensive experiments on three Vietnamese benchmarks (UITOpenViIC, KTVIC, and Crossmodal-3600) demonstrate that ViCLIP-OT consistently outperforms CLIP and SigLIP baselines in both in-domain and zero-shot settings. On UIT-OpenViIC, the model achieves an average Recall@K of 67.34%, improving upon CLIP by 5.75 percentage points. In zero-shot evaluation on Crossmodal-3600, ViCLIPOT surpasses CLIP by 11.72 percentage points. Embedding-space analysis further confirms improved alignment and reduced modality gap. The results indicate that integrating SIGROT provides an effective and scalable strategy for cross-modal retrieval in low-resource languages, offering practical implications for intelligent multimedia retrieval systems in Vietnamese and other underrepresented linguistic contexts.

### SPMamba-YOLO: An Underwater Object Detection Network Based on Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement and Global Context Modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22674v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22674v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22674v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22674v1)

2026/02/26 06:45 GTM

Underwater object detection is a critical yet challenging research problem owing to severe light attenuation, color distortion, background clutter, and the small scale of underwater targets. To address these challenges, we propose SPMamba-YOLO, a novel underwater object detection network that integrates multi-scale feature enhancement with global context modeling. Specifically, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling Enhanced Layer Aggregation Network (SPPELAN) module is introduced to strengthen multi-scale feature aggregation and expand the receptive field, while a Pyramid Split Attention (PSA) mechanism enhances feature discrimination by emphasizing informative regions and suppressing background interference. In addition, a Mamba-based state space modeling module is incorporated to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and global contextual information, thereby improving detection robustness in complex underwater environments. Extensive experiments on the URPC2022 dataset demonstrate that SPMamba-YOLO outperforms the YOLOv8n baseline by more than 4.9\% in mAP@0.5, particularly for small and densely distributed underwater objects, while maintaining a favorable balance between detection accuracy and computational cost.

### Monocular Open Vocabulary Occupancy Prediction for Indoor Scenes
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22667v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22667v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22667v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22667v1)

2026/02/26 06:37 GTM

Open-vocabulary 3D occupancy is vital for embodied agents, which need to understand complex indoor environments where semantic categories are abundant and evolve beyond fixed taxonomies. While recent work has explored open-vocabulary occupancy in outdoor driving scenarios, such methods transfer poorly indoors, where geometry is denser, layouts are more intricate, and semantics are far more fine-grained. To address these challenges, we adopt a geometry-only supervision paradigm that uses only binary occupancy labels (occupied vs free). Our framework builds upon 3D Language-Embedded Gaussians, which serve as a unified intermediate representation coupling fine-grained 3D geometry with a language-aligned semantic embedding. On the geometry side, we find that existing Gaussian-to-Occupancy operators fail to converge under such weak supervision, and we introduce an opacity-aware, Poisson-based approach that stabilizes volumetric aggregation. On the semantic side, direct alignment between rendered features and open-vocabulary segmentation features suffers from feature mixing; we therefore propose a Progressive Temperature Decay schedule that gradually sharpens opacities during splatting, strengthening Gaussian-language alignment. On Occ-ScanNet, our framework achieves 59.50 IoU and 21.05 mIoU in the open-vocabulary setting, surpassing all existing occupancy methods in IoU and outperforming prior open-vocabulary approaches by a large margin in mIoU. Code will be released at https://github.com/JuIvyy/LegoOcc.

### ArtPro: Self-Supervised Articulated Object Reconstruction with Adaptive Integration of Mobility Proposals
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22666v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22666v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22666v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22666v1)

2026/02/26 06:35 GTM

Reconstructing articulated objects into high-fidelity digital twins is crucial for applications such as robotic manipulation and interactive simulation. Recent self-supervised methods using differentiable rendering frameworks like 3D Gaussian Splatting remain highly sensitive to the initial part segmentation. Their reliance on heuristic clustering or pre-trained models often causes optimization to converge to local minima, especially for complex multi-part objects. To address these limitations, we propose ArtPro, a novel self-supervised framework that introduces adaptive integration of mobility proposals. Our approach begins with an over-segmentation initialization guided by geometry features and motion priors, generating part proposals with plausible motion hypotheses. During optimization, we dynamically merge these proposals by analyzing motion consistency among spatial neighbors, while a collision-aware motion pruning mechanism prevents erroneous kinematic estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world objects demonstrate that ArtPro achieves robust reconstruction of complex multi-part objects, significantly outperforming existing methods in accuracy and stability.

### Scaling Audio-Visual Quality Assessment Dataset via Crowdsourcing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22659v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22659v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22659v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22659v1)

2026/02/26 06:18 GTM

Audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) research has been stalled by limitations of existing datasets: they are typically small in scale, with insufficient diversity in content and quality, and annotated only with overall scores. These shortcomings provide limited support for model development and multimodal perception research. We propose a practical approach for AVQA dataset construction. First, we design a crowdsourced subjective experiment framework for AVQA, breaks the constraints of in-lab settings and achieves reliable annotation across varied environments. Second, a systematic data preparation strategy is further employed to ensure broad coverage of both quality levels and semantic scenarios. Third, we extend the dataset with additional annotations, enabling research on multimodal perception mechanisms and their relation to content. Finally, we validate this approach through YT-NTU-AVQ, the largest and most diverse AVQA dataset to date, consisting of 1,620 user-generated audio and video (A/V) sequences.

### Denoising as Path Planning: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Models with DPCache
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22654v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22654v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22654v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22654v1)

Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image and video generation, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by the substantial computational overhead of multi-step iterative sampling. Among acceleration strategies, caching-based methods offer a training-free and effective solution by reusing or predicting features across timesteps. However, existing approaches rely on fixed or locally adaptive schedules without considering the global structure of the denoising trajectory, often leading to error accumulation and visual artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we propose DPCache, a novel training-free acceleration framework that formulates diffusion sampling acceleration as a global path planning problem. DPCache constructs a Path-Aware Cost Tensor from a small calibration set to quantify the path-dependent error of skipping timesteps conditioned on the preceding key timestep. Leveraging this tensor, DPCache employs dynamic programming to select an optimal sequence of key timesteps that minimizes the total path cost while preserving trajectory fidelity. During inference, the model performs full computations only at these key timesteps, while intermediate outputs are efficiently predicted using cached features. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that DPCache achieves strong acceleration with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior acceleration methods by $+$0.031 ImageReward at 4.87$\times$ speedup and even surpassing the full-step baseline by $+$0.028 ImageReward at 3.54$\times$ speedup on FLUX, validating the effectiveness of our path-aware global scheduling framework. Code will be released at https://github.com/argsss/DPCache.

### Interactive Medical-SAM2 GUI: A Napari-based semi-automatic annotation tool for medical images
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22649v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22649v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22649v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22649v1)

2026/02/26 06:05 GTM

Interactive Medical-SAM2 GUI is an open-source desktop application for semi-automatic annotation of 2D and 3D medical images. Built on the Napari multi-dimensional viewer, box/point prompting is integrated with SAM2-style propagation by treating a 3D volume as a slice sequence, enabling mask propagation from sparse prompts using Medical-SAM2 on top of SAM2. Voxel-level annotation remains essential for developing and validating medical imaging algorithms, yet manual labeling is slow and expensive for 3D scans, and existing integrations frequently emphasize per-slice interaction without providing a unified, cohort-oriented workflow for navigation, propagation, interactive correction, and quantitative export in a single local pipeline. To address this practical limitation, a local-first Napari workflow is provided for efficient 3D annotation across multiple studies using standard DICOM series and/or NIfTI volumes. Users can annotate cases sequentially under a single root folder with explicit proceed/skip actions, initialize objects via box-first prompting (including first/last-slice initialization for single-object propagation), refine predictions with point prompts, and finalize labels through prompt-first correction prior to saving. During export, per-object volumetry and 3D volume rendering are supported, and image geometry is preserved via SimpleITK. The GUI is implemented in Python using Napari and PyTorch, with optional N4 bias-field correction, and is intended exclusively for research annotation workflows. The code is released on the project page: https://github.com/SKKU-IBE/Medical-SAM2GUI/.

### Plug, Play, and Fortify: A Low-Cost Module for Robust Multimodal Image Understanding Models

Missing modalities present a fundamental challenge in multimodal models, often causing catastrophic performance degradation. Our observations suggest that this fragility stems from an imbalanced learning process, where the model develops an implicit preference for certain modalities, leading to the under-optimization of others. We propose a simple yet efficient method to address this challenge. The central insight of our work is that the dominance relationship between modalities can be effectively discerned and quantified in the frequency domain. To leverage this principle, we first introduce a Frequency Ratio Metric (FRM) to quantify modality preference by analyzing features in the frequency domain. Guided by FRM, we then propose a Multimodal Weight Allocation Module, a plug-and-play component that dynamically re-balances the contribution of each branch during training, promoting a more holistic learning paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MWAM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse architectural backbones, such as those based on CNNs and ViTs. Furthermore, MWAM delivers consistent performance gains across a wide range of tasks and modality combinations. This advancement extends beyond merely optimizing the performance of the base model; it also manifests as further performance improvements to state-of-the-art methods addressing the missing modality problem.

### QuadSync: Quadrifocal Tensor Synchronization via Tucker Decomposition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22639v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22639v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22639v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22639v1)

In structure from motion, quadrifocal tensors capture more information than their pairwise counterparts (essential matrices), yet they have often been thought of as impractical and only of theoretical interest. In this work, we challenge such beliefs by providing a new framework to recover $n$ cameras from the corresponding collection of quadrifocal tensors. We form the block quadrifocal tensor and show that it admits a Tucker decomposition whose factor matrices are the stacked camera matrices, and which thus has a multilinear rank of (4,~4,~4,~4) independent of $n$. We develop the first synchronization algorithm for quadrifocal tensors, using Tucker decomposition, alternating direction method of multipliers, and iteratively reweighted least squares. We further establish relationships between the block quadrifocal, trifocal, and bifocal tensors, and introduce an algorithm that jointly synchronizes these three entities. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on modern datasets, indicating the potential and importance of using higher-order information in synchronization.

### Scale Can't Overcome Pragmatics: The Impact of Reporting Bias on Vision-Language Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23351v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23351v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23351v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23351v1)

2026/02/26 18:54 GTM

The lack of reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has remained at the forefront of research discourse. We posit that this behavior stems from a reporting bias in their training data. That is, how people communicate about visual content by default omits tacit information needed to supervise some types of reasoning; e.g., "at the game today!" is a more likely caption than "a photo of 37 people standing behind a field". We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5 and Molmo through the lens of theories from pragmatics, and find that reporting bias results in insufficient representation of four reasoning skills (spatial, temporal, negation, and counting), despite the corpora being of web-scale, and/or synthetically generated. With a set of curated benchmarks, we demonstrate that: (i) VLMs perform poorly on the aforementioned types of reasoning suppressed in the training data by reporting bias; (ii) contrary to popular belief, scaling data size, model size, and to multiple languages does not result in emergence of these skills by default; but, promisingly, (iii) incorporating annotations specifically collected to obtain tacit information is effective. Our findings highlight the need for more intentional training data curation methods, rather than counting on scale for emergence of reasoning capabilities.

### LLM Novice Uplift on Dual-Use, In Silico Biology Tasks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23329v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23329v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23329v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23329v1)

2026/02/26 18:37 GTM

Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.

### A Mixture-of-Experts Model for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23300v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23300v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23300v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23300v1)

2026/02/26 18:08 GTM

Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) presents unique challenges, requiring models to capture the temporal flow of multi-turn dialogues and to effectively integrate cues from multiple modalities. We propose Mixture of Speech-Text Experts for Recognition of Emotions (MiSTER-E), a modular Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed to decouple two core challenges in ERC: modality-specific context modeling and multimodal information fusion. MiSTER-E leverages large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for both speech and text to provide rich utterance-level embeddings, which are then enhanced through a convolutional-recurrent context modeling layer. The system integrates predictions from three experts-speech-only, text-only, and cross-modal-using a learned gating mechanism that dynamically weighs their outputs. To further encourage consistency and alignment across modalities, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss between paired speech-text representations and a KL-divergence-based regulariza-tion across expert predictions. Importantly, MiSTER-E does not rely on speaker identity at any stage. Experiments on three benchmark datasets-IEMOCAP, MELD, and MOSI-show that our proposal achieves 70.9%, 69.5%, and 87.9% weighted F1-scores respectively, outperforming several baseline speech-text ERC systems. We also provide various ablations to highlight the contributions made in the proposed approach.

### SPARTA: Scalable and Principled Benchmark of Tree-Structured Multi-hop QA over Text and Tables
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23286v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23286v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23286v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23286v1)

Real-world Table-Text question answering (QA) tasks require models that can reason across long text and source tables, traversing multiple hops and executing complex operations such as aggregation. Yet existing benchmarks are small, manually curated - and therefore error-prone - and contain shallow questions that seldom demand more than two hops or invoke aggregations, grouping, or other advanced analytical operations expressible in natural-language queries. We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning. Our benchmark, construction code, and baseline models are available at https://github.com/pshlego/SPARTA/tree/main.

### Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response for Low-Latency Spoken Dialogue Systems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23266v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23266v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23266v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23266v1)

Achieving human-like responsiveness is a critical yet challenging goal for cascaded spoken dialogue systems. Conventional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines follow a strictly sequential paradigm, requiring complete transcription and full reasoning before speech synthesis can begin, which results in high response latency. We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs. Experiments on two spoken dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that DDTSR reduces response latency by 19%-51% while preserving discourse quality. Further analysis shows that DDTSR functions as a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse LLM backbones, and remains robust across varying utterance lengths, indicating strong practicality and scalability for real-time spoken interaction.

### AgentDropoutV2: Optimizing Information Flow in Multi-Agent Systems via Test-Time Rectify-or-Reject Pruning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23258v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23258v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23258v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23258v1)

While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns. Our code and dataset are released at https://github.com/TonySY2/AgentDropoutV2.

### Why Diffusion Language Models Struggle with Truly Parallel (Non-Autoregressive) Decoding?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23225v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23225v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23225v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23225v1)

2026/02/26 17:04 GTM

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are often advertised as enabling parallel token generation, yet practical fast DLMs frequently converge to left-to-right, autoregressive (AR)-like decoding dynamics. In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/NAP.

### InnerQ: Hardware-aware Tuning-free Quantization of KV Cache for Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23200v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23200v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23200v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23200v1)

2026/02/26 16:50 GTM

Reducing the hardware footprint of large language models (LLMs) during decoding is critical for efficient long-sequence generation. A key bottleneck is the key-value (KV) cache, whose size scales with sequence length and easily dominates the memory footprint of the model. Previous work proposed quantization methods that are focused on compressing the KV cache while maintaining its information. We introduce InnerQ, a hardware-aware KV-cache quantization scheme that lowers decode latency without sacrificing accuracy. InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping the cache matrices over their inner dimension. Unlike previous work that group over the outer dimension, InnerQ aligns dequantization with the vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. This reduces memory accesses and accelerates dequantization, yielding up to $22\%$ speedup over previous work and up to $88\%$ over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. To preserve fidelity under aggressive compression, InnerQ incorporates (i) hybrid quantization, selecting symmetric or asymmetric quantization per group based on local statistics; (ii) high-precision windows for both the most recent tokens and the attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage; and (iii) per-channel normalization of the key cache, computed once during prefill and folded into the query to avoid runtime overhead. Our evaluation experiments on Llama models shows that InnerQ maintains a few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior KV cache quantization methods.

### Fine-Tuning Without Forgetting In-Context Learning: A Theoretical Analysis of Linear Attention Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23197v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23197v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23197v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23197v1)

Transformer-based large language models exhibit in-context learning, enabling adaptation to downstream tasks via few-shot prompting with demonstrations. In practice, such models are often fine-tuned to improve zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, allowing them to solve tasks without examples and thereby reducing inference costs. However, fine-tuning can degrade in-context learning, limiting the performance of fine-tuned models on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning. We further show that incorporating an auxiliary few-shot loss enhances in-context learning primarily on the target task, at the expense of degraded in-context learning ability on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theoretical results.

### A Decision-Theoretic Formalisation of Steganography With Applications to LLM Monitoring
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23163v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23163v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23163v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23163v1)

2026/02/26 16:27 GTM

Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

### Modality Collapse as Mismatched Decoding: Information-Theoretic Limits of Multimodal LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23136v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23136v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23136v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23136v1)

2026/02/26 15:52 GTM

Multimodal LLMs can process speech and images, but they cannot hear a speaker's voice or see an object's texture. We show this is not a failure of encoding: speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes survive through every LLM layer (3--55$\times$ above chance in linear probes), yet removing 64--71% of modality-specific variance improves decoder loss. The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.
  We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection. A LoRA intervention demonstrates the fix: training with an emotion objective improves emotion accessibility ($+$7.5%) without affecting other attributes, confirming that the training objective determines what becomes accessible.

### Assessing Deanonymization Risks with Stylometry-Assisted LLM Agent

2026/02/26 15:05 GTM

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled powerful authorship inference capabilities, raising growing concerns about unintended deanonymization risks in textual data such as news articles. In this work, we introduce an LLM agent designed to evaluate and mitigate such risks through a structured, interpretable pipeline. Central to our framework is the proposed $\textit{SALA}$ (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis) method, which integrates quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning for robust and transparent authorship attribution. Experiments on large-scale news datasets demonstrate that $\textit{SALA}$, particularly when augmented with a database module, achieves high inference accuracy in various scenarios. Finally, we propose a guided recomposition strategy that leverages the agent's reasoning trace to generate rewriting prompts, effectively reducing authorship identifiability while preserving textual meaning. Our findings highlight both the deanonymization potential of LLM agents and the importance of interpretable, proactive defenses for safeguarding author privacy.

Large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance the efficiency of scholarly activities; however, challenges persist in the ethical deployment of AI assistance, including (1) the trustworthiness of AI-generated content, (2) preservation of academic integrity and intellectual property, and (3) protection of information privacy. In this work, we present CiteLLM, a specialized agentic platform designed to enable trustworthy reference discovery for grounding author-drafted claims and statements. The system introduces a novel interaction paradigm by embedding LLM utilities directly within the LaTeX editor environment, ensuring a seamless user experience and no data transmission outside the local system. To guarantee hallucination-free references, we employ dynamic discipline-aware routing to retrieve candidates exclusively from trusted web-based academic repositories, while leveraging LLMs solely for generating context-aware search queries, ranking candidates by relevance, and validating and explaining support through paragraph-level semantic matching and an integrated chatbot. Evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed system in returning valid and highly usable references.

### Quantity Convergence, Quality Divergence: Disentangling Fluency and Accuracy in L2 Mandarin Prosody

While second language (L2) learners may acquire target syntactic word order, mapping this syntax onto appropriate prosodic structures remains a persistent challenge. This study investigates the fossilization and stability of the L2 syntax-prosody interface by comparing 67 native Mandarin speakers with 67 Vietnamese learners using the BLCU-SAIT corpus. By integrating C-ToBI boundary annotation with Dependency Grammar analysis, we examined both the quantity of prosodic boundaries and their mapping to syntactic relations. Results reveal a non-linear acquisition: although high-proficiency learners (VNH) converge to the native baseline in boundary quantity at the Major Phrase level (B3), their structural mapping significantly diverges. Specifically, VNH demote the prosodic boundary at the Subject-Verb (SBV) interface (Major Phrase B3 -> Prosodic Word B1), while erroneously promoting the boundary at the Verb-Object (VOB) interface (Prosodic Word B1 -> Major Phrase B3). This strategy allows learners to maintain high long phrasal output at the expense of structural accuracy. This results in a distorted prosodic hierarchy where the native pattern is inverted.

### Make It Hard to Hear, Easy to Learn: Long-Form Bengali ASR and Speaker Diarization via Extreme Augmentation and Perfect Alignment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23070v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23070v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23070v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23070v1)

Although Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in Bengali has seen significant progress, processing long-duration audio and performing robust speaker diarization remain critical research gaps. To address the severe scarcity of joint ASR and diarization resources for this language, we introduce Lipi-Ghor-882, a comprehensive 882-hour multi-speaker Bengali dataset. In this paper, detailing our submission to the DL Sprint 4.0 competition, we systematically evaluate various architectures and approaches for long-form Bengali speech. For ASR, we demonstrate that raw data scaling is ineffective; instead, targeted fine-tuning utilizing perfectly aligned annotations paired with synthetic acoustic degradation (noise and reverberation) emerges as the singular most effective approach. Conversely, for speaker diarization, we observed that global open-source state-of-the-art models (such as Diarizen) performed surprisingly poorly on this complex dataset. Extensive model retraining yielded negligible improvements; instead, strategic, heuristic post-processing of baseline model outputs proved to be the primary driver for increasing accuracy. Ultimately, this work outlines a highly optimized dual pipeline achieving a $\sim$0.019 Real-Time Factor (RTF), establishing a practical, empirically backed benchmark for low-resource, long-form speech processing.

[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23062v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23062v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23062v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23062v1)

Case Report Forms (CRFs) collect data about patients and are at the core of well-established practices to conduct research in clinical settings. With the recent progress of language technologies, there is an increasing interest in automatic CRF-filling from clinical notes, mostly based on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is a general scarcity of annotated CRF data, both for training and testing LLMs, which limits the progress on this task. As a step in the direction of providing such data, we present a new dataset of clinical notes from an Italian Emergency Department annotated with respect to a pre-defined CRF containing 134 items to be filled. We provide an analysis of the data, define the CRF-filling task and metric for its evaluation, and report on pilot experiments where we use an open-source state-of-the-art LLM to automatically execute the task. Results of the case-study show that (i) CRF-filling from real clinical notes in Italian can be approached in a zero-shot setting; (ii) LLMs' results are affected by biases (e.g., a cautious behaviour favours "unknown" answers), which need to be corrected.

### MoDora: Tree-Based Semi-Structured Document Analysis System

Semi-structured documents integrate diverse interleaved data elements (e.g., tables, charts, hierarchical paragraphs) arranged in various and often irregular layouts. These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.
  To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval. Experiments show MoDora outperforms baselines by 5.97%-61.07% in accuracy. The code is at https://github.com/weAIDB/MoDora.

### Affine-Scaled Attention: Towards Flexible and Stable Transformer Attention
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23057v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23057v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23057v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23057v1)

Transformer attention is typically implemented using softmax normalization, which enforces attention weights with unit sum normalization. While effective in many settings, this constraint can limit flexibility in controlling attention magnitudes and may contribute to overly concentrated or unstable attention patterns during training. Prior work has explored modifications such as attention sinks or gating mechanisms, but these approaches provide only limited or indirect control over attention reweighting. We propose Affine-Scaled Attention, a simple extension to standard attention that introduces input-dependent scaling and a corresponding bias term applied to softmax-normalized attention weights. This design relaxes the strict normalization constraint while maintaining aggregation of value representations, allowing the model to adjust both the relative distribution and the scale of attention in a controlled manner.
  We empirically evaluate Affine-Scaled Attention in large-scale language model pretraining across multiple model sizes. Experimental results show consistent improvements in training stability, optimization behavior, and downstream task performance compared to standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines. These findings suggest that modest reweighting of attention outputs provides a practical and effective way to improve attention behavior in Transformer models.

### Frequency-Ordered Tokenization for Better Text Compression
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22958v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22958v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22958v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22958v1)

2026/02/26 12:53 GTM

We present frequency-ordered tokenization, a simple preprocessing technique that improves lossless text compression by exploiting the power-law frequency distribution of natural language tokens (Zipf's law). The method tokenizes text with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), reorders the vocabulary so that frequent tokens receive small integer identifiers, and encodes the result with variable-length integers before passing it to any standard compressor. On enwik8 (100 MB Wikipedia), this yields improvements of 7.08 percentage points (pp) for zlib, 1.69 pp for LZMA, and 0.76 pp for zstd (all including vocabulary overhead), outperforming the classical Word Replacing Transform. Gains are consistent at 1 GB scale (enwik9) and across Chinese and Arabic text. We further show that preprocessing accelerates compression for computationally expensive algorithms: the total wall-clock time including preprocessing is 3.1x faster than raw zstd-22 and 2.4x faster than raw LZMA, because the preprocessed input is substantially smaller. The method can be implemented in under 50 lines of code.

### Where Vision Becomes Text: Locating the OCR Routing Bottleneck in Vision-Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22918v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22918v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22918v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22918v1)

2026/02/26 12:06 GTM

Vision-language models (VLMs) can read text from images, but where does this optical character recognition (OCR) information enter the language processing stream? We investigate the OCR routing mechanism across three architecture families (Qwen3-VL, Phi-4, InternVL3.5) using causal interventions. By computing activation differences between original images and text-inpainted versions, we identify architecture-specific OCR bottlenecks whose dominant location depends on the vision-language integration strategy: DeepStack models (Qwen) show peak sensitivity at mid-depth (about 50%) for scene text, while single-stage projection models (Phi-4, InternVL) peak at early layers (6-25%), though the exact layer of maximum effect varies across datasets. The OCR signal is remarkably low-dimensional: PC1 captures 72.9% of variance. Crucially, principal component analysis (PCA) directions learned on one dataset transfer to others, demonstrating shared text-processing pathways. Surprisingly, in models with modular OCR circuits (notably Qwen3-VL-4B), OCR removal can improve counting performance (up to +6.9 percentage points), suggesting OCR interferes with other visual processing in sufficiently modular architectures.

### NoRA: Breaking the Linear Ceiling of Low-Rank Adaptation via Manifold Expansion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22911v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22911v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22911v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22911v1)

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) dominates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, it faces a critical ``linear ceiling'' in complex reasoning tasks: simply increasing the rank yields diminishing returns due to intrinsic linear constraints. We introduce NoRA (Non-linear Rank Adaptation), a weight-level parallel adapter that injects SiLU gating and structural dropout to induce manifold expansion. On the SlimOrca benchmark, NoRA breaks this linear barrier: NoRA remarkably at rank 64 (PPL 3.89) outperforms LoRA at rank 512 (PPL 3.90), demonstrating superior spectral efficiency. This advantage generalizes to mathematical reasoning, where NoRA achieves a perplexity of 1.97 on MathInstruct, significantly surpassing LoRA's saturation point of 2.07. Mechanism analysis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) confirms that NoRA activates the dormant tail of the singular value spectrum, effectively preventing the rank collapse observed in linear methods.

### OmniGAIA: Towards Native Omni-Modal AI Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22897v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22897v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22897v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22897v1)

Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.

### Test-Time Scaling with Diffusion Language Models via Reward-Guided Stitching
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22871v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22871v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22871v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22871v1)

2026/02/26 11:08 GTM

Reasoning with large language models often benefits from generating multiple chains-of-thought, but existing aggregation strategies are typically trajectory-level (e.g., selecting the best trace or voting on the final answer), discarding useful intermediate work from partial or "nearly correct" attempts. We propose Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, a self-consistency framework that turns cheap diffusion-sampled reasoning into a reusable pool of step-level candidates. Given a problem, we (i) sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, (ii) score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM), and (iii) stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale. This rationale then conditions an autoregressive (AR) model (solver) to recompute only the final answer. This modular pipeline separates exploration (diffusion) from evaluation and solution synthesis, avoiding monolithic unified hybrids while preserving broad search. Across math reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level recombination is most beneficial on harder problems, and ablations highlight the importance of the final AR solver in converting stitched but imperfect rationales into accurate answers. Using low-confidence diffusion sampling with parallel, independent rollouts, our training-free framework improves average accuracy by up to 23.8% across six math and coding tasks. At the same time, it achieves up to a 1.8x latency reduction relative to both traditional diffusion models (e.g., Dream, LLaDA) and unified architectures (e.g., TiDAR). Code is available at https://github.com/roymiles/diffusion-stitching.

### Rejection Mixing: Fast Semantic Propagation of Mask Tokens for Efficient DLLM Inference
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22868v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22868v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22868v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22868v1)

2026/02/26 11:08 GTM

Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) promise fast non-autoregressive inference but suffer a severe quality-speed trade-off in parallel decoding. This stems from the ''combinatorial contradiction'' phenomenon, where parallel tokens form semantically inconsistent combinations. We address this by integrating continuous representations into the discrete decoding process, as they preserve rich inter-position dependency. We propose ReMix (Rejection Mixing), a framework that introduces a novel Continuous Mixing State as an intermediate between the initial masked state and the final decoded token state. This intermediate state allows a token's representation to be iteratively refined in a continuous space, resolving mutual conflicts with other tokens before collapsing into a final discrete sample. Furthermore, a rejection rule reverts uncertain representations from the continuous state back to the masked state for reprocessing, ensuring stability and preventing error propagation. ReMix thus mitigates combinatorial contradictions by enabling continuous-space refinement during discrete diffusion decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMix, as a training-free method, achieves a $2-8 \times$ inference speedup without any quality degradation.

### Effective QA-driven Annotation of Predicate-Argument Relations Across Languages
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22865v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22865v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22865v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22865v1)

2026/02/26 11:01 GTM

Explicit representations of predicate-argument relations form the basis of interpretable semantic analysis, supporting reasoning, generation, and evaluation. However, attaining such semantic structures requires costly annotation efforts and has remained largely confined to English. We leverage the Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) framework -- a natural-language formulation of predicate-argument relations -- as the foundation for extending semantic annotation to new languages. To this end, we introduce a cross-linguistic projection approach that reuses an English QA-SRL parser within a constrained translation and word-alignment pipeline to automatically generate question-answer annotations aligned with target-language predicates. Applied to Hebrew, Russian, and French -- spanning diverse language families -- the method yields high-quality training data and fine-tuned, language-specific parsers that outperform strong multilingual LLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaMA-Maverick). By leveraging QA-SRL as a transferable natural-language interface for semantics, our approach enables efficient and broadly accessible predicate-argument parsing across languages.

### Improving Neural Argumentative Stance Classification in Controversial Topics with Emotion-Lexicon Features
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22846v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22846v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22846v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22846v1)

Argumentation mining comprises several subtasks, among which stance classification focuses on identifying the standpoint expressed in an argumentative text toward a specific target topic. While arguments-especially about controversial topics-often appeal to emotions, most prior work has not systematically incorporated explicit, fine-grained emotion analysis to improve performance on this task. In particular, prior research on stance classification has predominantly utilized non-argumentative texts and has been restricted to specific domains or topics, limiting generalizability. We work on five datasets from diverse domains encompassing a range of controversial topics and present an approach for expanding the Bias-Corrected NRC Emotion Lexicon using DistilBERT embeddings, which we feed into a Neural Argumentative Stance Classification model. Our method systematically expands the emotion lexicon through contextualized embeddings to identify emotionally charged terms not previously captured in the lexicon. Our expanded NRC lexicon (eNRC) improves over the baseline across all five datasets (up to +6.2 percentage points in F1 score), outperforms the original NRC on four datasets (up to +3.0), and surpasses the LLM-based approach on nearly all corpora. We provide all resources-including eNRC, the adapted corpora, and model architecture-to enable other researchers to build upon our work.

### Moral Preferences of LLMs Under Directed Contextual Influence
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22831v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22831v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22831v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22831v1)

Moral benchmarks for LLMs typically use context-free prompts, implicitly assuming stable preferences. In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior.

### TCM-DiffRAG: Personalized Syndrome Differentiation Reasoning Method for Traditional Chinese Medicine based on Knowledge Graph and Chain of Thought
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22828v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22828v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22828v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22828v1)

2026/02/26 10:11 GTM

Background: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology can empower large language models (LLMs) to generate more accurate, professional, and timely responses without fine tuning. However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) with chains of thought (CoT). TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned (SFT) LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning. These results highlight the potential of reasoning-aware RAG frameworks for advancing LLM applications in traditional Chinese medicine.

### TARAZ: Persian Short-Answer Question Benchmark for Cultural Evaluation of Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22827v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22827v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22827v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22827v1)

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the cultural competence of large language models (LLMs) in Persian. Existing Persian cultural benchmarks rely predominantly on multiple-choice formats and English-centric metrics that fail to capture Persian's morphological complexity and semantic nuance. Our framework introduces a Persian-specific short-answer evaluation that combines rule-based morphological normalization with a hybrid syntactic and semantic similarity module, enabling robust soft-match scoring beyond exact string overlap. Through systematic evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models, we demonstrate that our hybrid evaluation improves scoring consistency by +10% compared to exact-match baselines by capturing meaning that surface-level methods cannot detect. We publicly release our evaluation framework, providing the first standardized benchmark for measuring cultural understanding in Persian and establishing a reproducible foundation for cross-cultural LLM evaluation research.

### Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P): A Modular Governance Method for Prompt Design Under Model Drift
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22790v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22790v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22790v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22790v1)

The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed prompt engineering from a localized craft into a systems-level governance challenge. As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P. All conceptual framing, methodological claims, and final revisions were directed, reviewed, and approved by the human author under a documented human-in-the-loop protocol. The paper concludes by outlining implications for declarative control under ongoing model evolution and identifying directions for future empirical validation.

### Probing for Knowledge Attribution in Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22787v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22787v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22787v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22787v1)

Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but unfounded claims, or hallucinations, which fall into two types: (i) faithfulness violations - misusing user context - and (ii) factuality violations - errors from internal knowledge. Proper mitigation depends on knowing whether a model's answer is based on the prompt or its internal weights. This work focuses on the problem of contributive attribution: identifying the dominant knowledge source behind each output. We show that a probe, a simple linear classifier trained on model hidden representations, can reliably predict contributive attribution. For its training, we introduce AttriWiki, a self-supervised data pipeline that prompts models to recall withheld entities from memory or read them from context, generating labelled examples automatically. Probes trained on AttriWiki data reveal a strong attribution signal, achieving up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, transferring to out-of-domain benchmarks (SQuAD, WebQuestions) with 0.94-0.99 Macro-F1 without retraining. Attribution mismatches raise error rates by up to 70%, demonstrating a direct link between knowledge source confusion and unfaithful answers. Yet, models may still respond incorrectly even when attribution is correct, highlighting the need for broader detection frameworks.

### TherapyProbe: Generating Design Knowledge for Relational Safety in Mental Health Chatbots Through Adversarial Simulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22775v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22775v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22775v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22775v1)

2026/02/26 09:11 GTM

As mental health chatbots proliferate to address the global treatment gap, a critical question emerges: How do we design for relational safety the quality of interaction patterns that unfold across conversations rather than the correctness of individual responses? Current safety evaluations assess single-turn crisis responses, missing the therapeutic dynamics that determine whether chatbots help or harm over time. We introduce TherapyProbe, a design probe methodology that generates actionable design knowledge by systematically exploring chatbot conversation trajectories through adversarial multi-agent simulation. Using open-source models, TherapyProbe surfaces relational safety failures interaction patterns like "validation spirals" where chatbots progressively reinforce hopelessness, or "empathy fatigue" where responses become mechanical over turns. Our contribution is translating these failures into a Safety Pattern Library of 23 failure archetypes with corresponding design recommendations. We contribute: (1) a replicable methodology requiring no API costs, (2) a clinically-grounded failure taxonomy, and (3) design implications for developers, clinicians, and policymakers.

### Imagination Helps Visual Reasoning, But Not Yet in Latent Space
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22766v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22766v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22766v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22766v1)

Latent visual reasoning aims to mimic human's imagination process by meditating through hidden states of Multimodal Large Language Models. While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. Motivated to demystify the true source of its efficacy, we investigate the validity of latent reasoning using Causal Mediation Analysis. We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. (b) Latent-Answer Disconnect: perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity. Consequently, we challenge the necessity of latent reasoning and propose a straightforward alternative named CapImagine, which teaches the model to explicitly imagine using text. Experiments on vision-centric benchmarks show that CapImagine significantly outperforms complex latent-space baselines, highlighting the superior potential of visual reasoning through explicit imagination.

### Towards Better RL Training Data Utilization via Second-Order Rollout
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22765v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22765v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22765v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22765v1)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities, but vanilla RL mainly focuses on generation capability improvement by training with only first-order rollout (generating multiple responses for a question), and we argue that this approach fails to fully exploit the potential of training data because of the neglect of critique capability training. To tackle this problem, we further introduce the concept of second-order rollout (generating multiple critiques for a response) and propose a unified framework for jointly training generation and critique capabilities. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate that our approach can utilize training data more effectively than vanilla RL and achieve better performance under the same training data. Additionally, we uncover several insightful findings regarding second-order rollout and critique training, such as the importance of label balance in critique training and the noise problem of outcome-based rewards, which can be mitigated through sampling techniques. Our work offers a preliminary exploration of dynamic data augmentation and joint generation-critique training in RL, providing meaningful inspiration for the further advancement of RL training

### AuditBench: Evaluating Alignment Auditing Techniques on Models with Hidden Behaviors
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22755v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22755v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22755v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22755v1)

2026/02/26 08:43 GTM

We introduce AuditBench, an alignment auditing benchmark. AuditBench consists of 56 language models with implanted hidden behaviors. Each model has one of 14 concerning behaviors--such as sycophantic deference, opposition to AI regulation, or secret geopolitical loyalties--which it does not confess to when directly asked. AuditBench models are highly diverse--some are subtle, while others are overt, and we use varying training techniques both for implanting behaviors and training models not to confess. To demonstrate AuditBench's utility, we develop an investigator agent that autonomously employs a configurable set of auditing tools. By measuring investigator agent success using different tools, we can evaluate their efficacy. Notably, we observe a tool-to-agent gap, where tools that perform well in standalone non-agentic evaluations fail to translate into improved performance when used with our investigator agent. We find that our most effective tools involve scaffolded calls to auxiliary models that generate diverse prompts for the target. White-box interpretability tools can be helpful, but the agent performs best with black-box tools. We also find that audit success varies greatly across training techniques: models trained on synthetic documents are easier to audit than models trained on demonstrations, with better adversarial training further increasing auditing difficulty. We release our models, agent, and evaluation framework to support future quantitative, iterative science on alignment auditing.

The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from exploratory tools to active "silicon subjects" in social science lacks extensive validation of operational validity. This study introduces Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP), a task in which a model predicts how a user would comment on a given stimulus by comparing generated outputs with authentic digital traces. This framework enables a rigorous evaluation of current LLM capabilities with respect to the simulation of social media user behavior. We evaluated open-weight 8B models (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish language scenarios. By systematically comparing prompting strategies (explicit vs. implicit) and the impact of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we identify a critical form vs. content decoupling in low-resource settings: while SFT aligns the surface structure of the text output (length and syntax), it degrades semantic grounding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicit conditioning (generated biographies) becomes redundant under fine-tuning, as models successfully perform latent inference directly from behavioral histories. Our findings challenge current "naive prompting" paradigms and offer operational guidelines prioritizing authentic behavioral traces over descriptive personas for high-fidelity simulation.

### Extending Czech Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Opinion Terms: Dataset and LLM Benchmarks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22730v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22730v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22730v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22730v1)

This paper introduces a novel Czech dataset in the restaurant domain for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), enriched with annotations of opinion terms. The dataset supports three distinct ABSA tasks involving opinion terms, accommodating varying levels of complexity. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments using modern Transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), in monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual settings. To address cross-lingual challenges, we propose a translation and label alignment methodology leveraging LLMs, which yields consistent improvements. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art models, especially when handling the linguistic intricacies of low-resource languages like Czech. A detailed error analysis reveals key challenges, including the detection of subtle opinion terms and nuanced sentiment expressions. The dataset establishes a new benchmark for Czech ABSA, and our proposed translation-alignment approach offers a scalable solution for adapting ABSA resources to other low-resource languages.

### Human Label Variation in Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition

There is growing recognition that many NLP tasks lack a single ground truth, as human judgments reflect diverse perspectives. To capture this variation, models have been developed to predict full annotation distributions rather than majority labels, while perspectivist models aim to reproduce the interpretations of individual annotators. In this work, we compare these approaches on Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR), a highly ambiguous task where disagreement often arises from cognitive complexity rather than ideological bias. Our experiments show that existing annotator-specific models perform poorly in IDRR unless ambiguity is reduced, whereas models trained on label distributions yield more stable predictions. Further analysis indicates that frequent cognitively demanding cases drive inconsistency in human interpretation, posing challenges for perspectivist modeling in IDRR.

### Replacing Multi-Step Assembly of Data Preparation Pipelines with One-Step LLM Pipeline Generation for Table QA
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22721v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22721v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22721v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22721v1)

Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions over structured tables. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable promising solutions to this problem, with operator-centric solutions that generate table manipulation pipelines in a multi-step manner offering state-of-the-art performance. However, these solutions rely on multiple LLM calls, resulting in prohibitive latencies and computational costs.
  We propose Operation-R1, the first framework that trains lightweight LLMs (e.g., Qwen-4B/1.7B) via a novel variant of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to produce high-quality data-preparation pipelines for TQA in a single inference step. To train such an LLM, we first introduce a self-supervised rewarding mechanism to automatically obtain fine-grained pipeline-wise supervision signals for LLM training. We also propose variance-aware group resampling to mitigate training instability. To further enhance robustness of pipeline generation, we develop two complementary mechanisms: operation merge, which filters spurious operations through multi-candidate consensus, and adaptive rollback, which offers runtime protection against information loss in data transformation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that, with the same LLM backbone, Operation-R1 achieves average absolute accuracy gains of 9.55 and 6.08 percentage points over multi-step preparation baselines, with 79\% table compression and a 2.2$\times$ reduction in monetary cost.

### Tokenization, Fusion and Decoupling: Bridging the Granularity Mismatch Between Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22698v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22698v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22698v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22698v1)

2026/02/26 07:20 GTM

Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is promising but hindered by a fundamental granularity mismatch. LLMs operate on fragmented token sequences, whereas entities are the fundamental units in knowledge graphs (KGs) scenarios. Existing approaches typically constrain predictions to limited candidate sets or align entities with the LLM's vocabulary by pooling multiple tokens or decomposing entities into fixed-length token sequences, which fail to capture both the semantic meaning of the text and the structural integrity of the graph. To address this, we propose KGT, a novel framework that uses dedicated entity tokens to enable efficient, full-space prediction. Specifically, we first introduce specialized tokenization to construct feature representations at the level of dedicated entity tokens. We then fuse pre-trained structural and textual features into these unified embeddings via a relation-guided gating mechanism, avoiding training from scratch. Finally, we implement decoupled prediction by leveraging independent heads to separate and combine semantic and structural reasoning. Experimental results show that KGT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

### Reinforcing Real-world Service Agents: Balancing Utility and Cost in Task-oriented Dialogue
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22697v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22697v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22697v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22697v1)

The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has accelerated the transition from conversational chatbots to general agents. However, effectively balancing empathetic communication with budget-aware decision-making remains an open challenge. Since existing methods fail to capture these complex strategic trade-offs, we propose InteractCS-RL, a framework that reframes task-oriented dialogue as a multi-granularity reinforcement learning process. Specifically, we first establish a User-centric Interaction Framework to provide a high-fidelity training gym, enabling agents to dynamically explore diverse strategies with persona-driven users. Then, we introduce Cost-aware Multi-turn Policy Optimization (CMPO) with a hybrid advantage estimation strategy. By integrating generative process credits and employing a PID-Lagrangian cost controller, CMPO effectively guides the policy to explore Pareto boundary between user reward and global cost constraints. Extensive experiments on customized real business scenarios demonstrate that InteractCS-RL significantly outperform other baselines across three evaluation dimensions. Further evaluation on tool-agent-user interaction benchmarks verify InteractCS-RL robustness across diverse domains.

### Enhancing Persuasive Dialogue Agents by Synthesizing Cross-Disciplinary Communication Strategies

2026/02/26 07:18 GTM

Current approaches to developing persuasive dialogue agents often rely on a limited set of predefined persuasive strategies that fail to capture the complexity of real-world interactions. We applied a cross-disciplinary approach to develop a framework for designing persuasive dialogue agents that draws on proven strategies from social psychology, behavioral economics, and communication theory. We validated our proposed framework through experiments on two distinct datasets: the Persuasion for Good dataset, which represents a specific in-domain scenario, and the DailyPersuasion dataset, which encompasses a wide range of scenarios. The proposed framework achieved strong results for both datasets and demonstrated notable improvement in the persuasion success rate as well as promising generalizability. Notably, the proposed framework also excelled at persuading individuals with initially low intent, which addresses a critical challenge for persuasive dialogue agents.

### Search More, Think Less: Rethinking Long-Horizon Agentic Search for Efficiency and Generalization

Recent deep research agents primarily improve performance by scaling reasoning depth, but this leads to high inference cost and latency in search-intensive scenarios. Moreover, generalization across heterogeneous research settings remains challenging. In this work, we propose \emph{Search More, Think Less} (SMTL), a framework for long-horizon agentic search that targets both efficiency and generalization. SMTL replaces sequential reasoning with parallel evidence acquisition, enabling efficient context management under constrained context budgets. To support generalization across task types, we further introduce a unified data synthesis pipeline that constructs search tasks spanning both deterministic question answering and open-ended research scenarios with task appropriate evaluation metrics. We train an end-to-end agent using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving strong and often state of the art performance across benchmarks including BrowseComp (48.6\%), GAIA (75.7\%), Xbench (82.0\%), and DeepResearch Bench (45.9\%). Compared to Mirothinker-v1.0, SMTL with maximum 100 interaction steps reduces the average number of reasoning steps on BrowseComp by 70.7\%, while improving accuracy.

### dLLM: Simple Diffusion Language Modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22661v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22661v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22661v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22661v1)

Although diffusion language models (DLMs) are evolving quickly, many recent models converge on a set of shared components. These components, however, are distributed across ad-hoc research codebases or lack transparent implementations, making them difficult to reproduce or extend. As the field accelerates, there is a clear need for a unified framework that standardizes these common components while remaining flexible enough to support new methods and architectures.
  To address this gap, we introduce dLLM, an open-source framework that unifies the core components of diffusion language modeling -- training, inference, and evaluation -- and makes them easy to customize for new designs. With dLLM, users can reproduce, finetune, deploy, and evaluate open-source large DLMs such as LLaDA and Dream through a standardized pipeline. The framework also provides minimal, reproducible recipes for building small DLMs from scratch with accessible compute, including converting any BERT-style encoder or autoregressive LM into a DLM. We also release the checkpoints of these small DLMs to make DLMs more accessible and accelerate future research.

### Deepfake Word Detection by Next-token Prediction using Fine-tuned Whisper
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22658v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22658v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22658v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22658v1)

2026/02/26 06:17 GTM

Deepfake speech utterances can be forged by replacing one or more words in a bona fide utterance with semantically different words synthesized by speech generative models. While a dedicated synthetic word detector could be developed, we investigate a cost-effective method that fine-tunes a pre-trained Whisper model to detect synthetic words while transcribing the input utterance via next-token prediction. We further investigate using partially vocoded utterances as the fine-tuning data, thereby reducing the cost of data collection. Our experiments demonstrate that, on in-domain test data, the fine-tuned Whisper yields low synthetic-word detection error rates and transcription error rates. On out-of-domain test data with synthetic words produced by unseen speech generative models, the fine-tuned Whisper remains on par with a dedicated ResNet-based detection model; however, the overall performance degradation calls for strategies to improve its generalization capability.

### Vectorizing the Trie: Efficient Constrained Decoding for LLM-based Generative Retrieval on Accelerators
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22647v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22647v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22647v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22647v1)

Generative retrieval has emerged as a powerful paradigm for LLM-based recommendation. However, industrial recommender systems often benefit from restricting the output space to a constrained subset of items based on business logic (e.g. enforcing content freshness or product category), which standard autoregressive decoding cannot natively support. Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees (Tries) incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators (TPUs/GPUs). In this work, we introduce STATIC (Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding), an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUs/GPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead (0.033 ms per step and 0.25% of inference time), achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval. In addition, evaluation on academic benchmarks demonstrates that STATIC can considerably improve cold-start performance for generative retrieval.

### Evaluating Zero-Shot and One-Shot Adaptation of Small Language Models in Leader-Follower Interaction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23312v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23312v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23312v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23312v1)

Leader-follower interaction is an important paradigm in human-robot interaction (HRI). Yet, assigning roles in real time remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile and assistive robots. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for natural communication, their size and latency limit on-device deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a potential alternative, but their effectiveness for role classification in HRI has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we present a benchmark of SLMs for leader-follower communication, introducing a novel dataset derived from a published database and augmented with synthetic samples to capture interaction-specific dynamics. We investigate two adaptation strategies: prompt engineering and fine-tuning, studied under zero-shot and one-shot interaction modes, compared with an untrained baseline. Experiments with Qwen2.5-0.5B reveal that zero-shot fine-tuning achieves robust classification performance (86.66% accuracy) while maintaining low latency (22.2 ms per sample), significantly outperforming baseline and prompt-engineered approaches. However, results also indicate a performance degradation in one-shot modes, where increased context length challenges the model's architectural capacity. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuned SLMs provide an effective solution for direct role assignment, while highlighting critical trade-offs between dialogue complexity and classification reliability on the edge.

### Interface-Aware Trajectory Reconstruction of Limited Demonstrations for Robot Learning

Assistive robots offer agency to humans with severe motor impairments. Often, these users control high-DoF robots through low-dimensional interfaces, such as using a 1-D sip-and-puff interface to operate a 6-DoF robotic arm. This mismatch results in having access to only a subset of control dimensions at a given time, imposing unintended and artificial constraints on robot motion. As a result, interface-limited demonstrations embed suboptimal motions that reflect interface restrictions rather than user intent. To address this, we present a trajectory reconstruction algorithm that reasons about task, environment, and interface constraints to lift demonstrations into the robot's full control space. We evaluate our approach using real-world demonstrations of ADL-inspired tasks performed via a 2-D joystick and 1-D sip-and-puff control interface, teleoperating two distinct 7-DoF robotic arms. Analyses of the reconstructed demonstrations and derived control policies show that lifted trajectories are faster and more efficient than their interface-constrained counterparts while respecting user preferences.

### Simple Models, Real Swimming: Digital Twins for Tendon-Driven Underwater Robots

Mimicking the graceful motion of swimming animals remains a core challenge in soft robotics due to the complexity of fluid-structure interaction and the difficulty of controlling soft, biomimetic bodies. Existing modeling approaches are often computationally expensive and impractical for complex control or reinforcement learning needed for realistic motions to emerge in robotic systems. In this work, we present a tendon-driven fish robot modeled in an efficient underwater swimmer environment using a simplified, stateless hydrodynamics formulation implemented in the widespread robotics framework MuJoCo. With just two real-world swimming trajectories, we identify five fluid parameters that allow a matching to experimental behavior and generalize across a range of actuation frequencies. We show that this stateless fluid model can generalize to unseen actuation and outperform classical analytical models such as the elongated body theory. This simulation environment runs faster than real-time and can easily enable downstream learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning for target tracking, reaching a 93% success rate. Due to the simplicity and ease of use of the model and our open-source simulation environment, our results show that even simple, stateless models -- when carefully matched to physical data -- can serve as effective digital twins for soft underwater robots, opening up new directions for scalable learning and control in aquatic environments.

### Physics Informed Viscous Value Representations

Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) learns goal-conditioned policies from static pre-collected datasets. However, accurate value estimation remains a challenge due to the limited coverage of the state-action space. Recent physics-informed approaches have sought to address this by imposing physical and geometric constraints on the value function through regularization defined over first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Eikonal equation. However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves geometric consistency, making it broadly applicable to navigation and high-dimensional, complex manipulation tasks. Open-source codes are available at https://github.com/HrishikeshVish/phys-fk-value-GCRL.

### Risk-Aware World Model Predictive Control for Generalizable End-to-End Autonomous Driving
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23259v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23259v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23259v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23259v1)

With advances in imitation learning (IL) and large-scale driving datasets, end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has made great progress recently. Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of "only driving like the expert" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration. Extensive experiments show that RaWMPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while providing superior decision interpretability.

### SPARR: Simulation-based Policies with Asymmetric Real-world Residuals for Assembly

Robotic assembly presents a long-standing challenge due to its requirement for precise, contact-rich manipulation. While simulation-based learning has enabled the development of robust assembly policies, their performance often degrades when deployed in real-world settings due to the sim-to-real gap. Conversely, real-world reinforcement learning (RL) methods avoid the sim-to-real gap, but rely heavily on human supervision and lack generalization ability to environmental changes. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines a simulation-trained base policy with a real-world residual policy to efficiently adapt to real-world variations. The base policy, trained in simulation using low-level state observations and dense rewards, provides strong priors for initial behavior. The residual policy, learned in the real world using visual observations and sparse rewards, compensates for discrepancies in dynamics and sensor noise. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our method, SPARR, achieves near-perfect success rates across diverse two-part assembly tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot sim-to-real methods, SPARR improves success rates by 38.4% while reducing cycle time by 29.7%. Moreover, SPARR requires no human expertise, in contrast to the state-of-the-art real-world RL approaches that depend heavily on human supervision.

### UniScale: Unified Scale-Aware 3D Reconstruction for Multi-View Understanding via Prior Injection for Robotic Perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23224v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23224v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23224v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23224v1)

2026/02/26 17:04 GTM

We present UniScale, a unified, scale-aware multi-view 3D reconstruction framework for robotic applications that flexibly integrates geometric priors through a modular, semantically informed design. In vision-based robotic navigation, the accurate extraction of environmental structure from raw image sequences is critical for downstream tasks. UniScale addresses this challenge with a single feed-forward network that jointly estimates camera intrinsics and extrinsics, scale-invariant depth and point maps, and the metric scale of a scene from multi-view images, while optionally incorporating auxiliary geometric priors when available. By combining global contextual reasoning with camera-aware feature representations, UniScale is able to recover the metric-scale of the scene. In robotic settings where camera intrinsics are known, they can be easily incorporated to improve performance, with additional gains obtained when camera poses are also available. This co-design enables robust, metric-aware 3D reconstruction within a single unified model. Importantly, UniScale does not require training from scratch, and leverages world priors exhibited in pre-existing models without geometric encoding strategies, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained robotic teams. We evaluate UniScale on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and consistent performance across diverse environments. We will release our implementation upon acceptance.

### Grasp, Slide, Roll: Comparative Analysis of Contact Modes for Tactile-Based Shape Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23206v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23206v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23206v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23206v1)

Tactile sensing allows robots to gather detailed geometric information about objects through physical interaction, complementing vision-based approaches. However, efficiently acquiring useful tactile data remains challenging due to the time-consuming nature of physical contact and the need to strategically choose contact locations that maximize information gain while minimizing physical interactions. This paper studies how different contact modes affect object shape reconstruction using a tactile-enabled dexterous gripper. We compare three contact interaction modes: grasp-releasing, sliding induced by finger-grazing, and palm-rolling. These contact modes are combined with an information-theoretic exploration framework that guides subsequent sampling locations using a shape completion model. Our results show that the improved tactile sensing efficiency of finger-grazing and palm-rolling translates into faster convergence in shape reconstruction, requiring 34% fewer physical interactions while improving reconstruction accuracy by 55%. We validate our approach using a UR5e robot arm equipped with an Inspire-Robots Dexterous Hand, showing robust performance across primitive object geometries.

### Motion-aware Event Suppression for Event Cameras

In this work, we introduce the first framework for Motion-aware Event Suppression, which learns to filter events triggered by IMOs and ego-motion in real time. Our model jointly segments IMOs in the current event stream while predicting their future motion, enabling anticipatory suppression of dynamic events before they occur. Our lightweight architecture achieves 173 Hz inference on consumer-grade GPUs with less than 1 GB of memory usage, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on the challenging EVIMO benchmark by 67\% in segmentation accuracy while operating at a 53\% higher inference rate. Moreover, we demonstrate significant benefits for downstream applications: our method accelerates Vision Transformer inference by 83\% via token pruning and improves event-based visual odometry accuracy, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 13\%.

### Latent Gaussian Splatting for 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23172v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23172v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23172v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23172v1)

Capturing 4D spatiotemporal surroundings is crucial for the safe and reliable operation of robots in dynamic environments. However, most existing methods address only one side of the problem: they either provide coarse geometric tracking via bounding boxes, or detailed 3D structures like voxel-based occupancy that lack explicit temporal association. In this work, we present Latent Gaussian Splatting for 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking (LaGS) that advances spatiotemporal scene understanding in a holistic direction. Our approach incorporates camera-based end-to-end tracking with mask-based multi-view panoptic occupancy prediction, and addresses the key challenge of efficiently aggregating multi-view information into 3D voxel grids via a novel latent Gaussian splatting approach. Specifically, we first fuse observations into 3D Gaussians that serve as a sparse point-centric latent representation of the 3D scene, and then splat the aggregated features onto a 3D voxel grid that is decoded by a mask-based segmentation head. We evaluate LaGS on the Occ3D nuScenes and Waymo datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance for 4D panoptic occupancy tracking. We make our code available at https://lags.cs.uni-freiburg.de/.

Estimating camera motion from monocular video is a fundamental problem in computer vision, central to tasks such as SLAM, visual odometry, and structure-from-motion. Existing methods that recover the camera's heading under known rotation, whether from an IMU or an optimization algorithm, tend to perform well in low-noise, low-outlier conditions, but often decrease in accuracy or become computationally expensive as noise and outlier levels increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalization of the Hough transform on the unit sphere (S(2)) to estimate the camera's heading. First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency. Additionally, experiments on SLAM show that the proposed method reduces RMSE by correcting the heading during camera pose initialization.

### Towards Intelligible Human-Robot Interaction: An Active Inference Approach to Occluded Pedestrian Scenarios

The sudden appearance of occluded pedestrians presents a critical safety challenge in autonomous driving. Conventional rule-based or purely data-driven approaches struggle with the inherent high uncertainty of these long-tail scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework grounded in Active Inference, which endows the agent with a human-like, belief-driven mechanism. Our framework leverages a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to efficiently estimate the pedestrian's hybrid state. To emulate human-like cognitive processes under uncertainty, we introduce a Conditional Belief Reset mechanism and a Hypothesis Injection technique to explicitly model beliefs about the pedestrian's multiple latent intentions. Planning is achieved via a Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller, which synergizes the efficient, iterative search of CEM with the inherent robustness of MPPI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the collision rate compared to reactive, rule-based, and reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, while also exhibiting explainable and human-like driving behavior that reflects the agent's internal belief state.

Energy-based predictive world models provide a powerful approach for multi-step visual planning by reasoning over latent energy landscapes rather than generating pixels. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: (i) their latent representations are typically learned in Euclidean space, neglecting the underlying geometric and hierarchical structure among states, and (ii) they struggle with long-horizon prediction, which leads to rapid degradation across extended rollouts. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoWorld, a geometric world model that preserves geometric structure and hierarchical relations through a Hyperbolic JEPA, which maps latent representations from Euclidean space onto hyperbolic manifolds. We further introduce Geometric Reinforcement Learning for energy-based optimization, enabling stable multi-step planning in hyperbolic latent space. Extensive experiments on CrossTask and COIN demonstrate around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to the state-of-the-art V-JEPA 2.

This paper presents the Marinarium, a modular and stand-alone underwater research facility designed to provide a realistic testbed for maritime and space-analog robotic experimentation in a resource-efficient manner. The Marinarium combines a fully instrumented underwater and aerial operational volume, extendable via a retractable roof for real-weather conditions, a digital twin in the SMaRCSim simulator and tight integration with a space robotics laboratory. All of these result from design choices aimed at bridging simulation, laboratory validation, and field conditions. We compare the Marinarium to similar existing infrastructures and illustrate how its design enables a set of experiments in four open research areas within field robotics. First, we exploit high-fidelity dynamics data from the tank to demonstrate the potential of learning-based system identification approaches applied to underwater vehicles. We further highlight the versatility of the multi-domain operating volume via a rendezvous mission with a heterogeneous fleet of robots across underwater, surface, and air. We then illustrate how the presented digital twin can be utilized to reduce the reality gap in underwater simulation. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of underwater surrogates for spacecraft navigation validation by executing spatiotemporally identical inspection tasks on a planar space-robot emulator and a neutrally buoyant \gls{rov}. In this work, by sharing the insights obtained and rationale behind the design and construction of the Marinarium, we hope to provide the field robotics research community with a blueprint for bridging the gap between controlled and real offshore and space robotics experimentation.

### An Empirical Analysis of Cooperative Perception for Occlusion Risk Mitigation

Occlusions present a significant challenge for connected and automated vehicles, as they can obscure critical road users from perception systems. Traditional risk metrics often fail to capture the cumulative nature of these threats over time adequately. In this paper, we propose a novel and universal risk assessment metric, the Risk of Tracking Loss (RTL), which aggregates instantaneous risk intensity throughout occluded periods. This provides a holistic risk profile that encompasses both high-intensity, short-term threats and prolonged exposure. Utilizing diverse and high-fidelity real-world datasets, a large-scale statistical analysis is conducted to characterize occlusion risk and validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric. The metric is applied to evaluate different vehicle-to-everything (V2X) deployment strategies. Our study shows that full V2X penetration theoretically eliminates this risk, the reduction is highly nonlinear; a substantial statistical benefit requires a high penetration threshold of 75-90%. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel asymmetric communication framework that allows even non-connected vehicles to receive warnings. Experimental results demonstrate that this paradigm achieves better risk mitigation performance. We found that our approach at 25% penetration outperforms the traditional symmetric model at 75%, and benefits saturate at only 50% penetration. This work provides a crucial risk assessment metric and a cost-effective, strategic roadmap for accelerating the safety benefits of V2X deployment.

### InCoM: Intent-Driven Perception and Structured Coordination for Whole-Body Mobile Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23024v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.23024v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23024v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.23024v1)

Whole-body mobile manipulation is a fundamental capability for general-purpose robotic agents, requiring both coordinated control of the mobile base and manipulator and robust perception under dynamically changing viewpoints. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: strong coupling between base and arm actions complicates whole-body control optimization, and perceptual attention is often poorly allocated as viewpoints shift during mobile manipulation. We propose InCoM, an intent-driven perception and structured coordination framework for whole-body mobile manipulation. InCoM infers latent motion intent to dynamically reweight multi-scale perceptual features, enabling stage-adaptive allocation of perceptual attention. To support robust cross-modal perception, InCoM further incorporates a geometric-semantic structured alignment mechanism that enhances multimodal correspondence. On the control side, we design a decoupled coordinated flow matching action decoder that explicitly models coordinated base-arm action generation, alleviating optimization difficulties caused by control coupling. Without access to privileged perceptual information, InCoM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three ManiSkill-HAB scenarios by 28.2%, 26.1%, and 23.6% in success rate, demonstrating strong effectiveness for whole-body mobile manipulation.

### DigiArm: An Anthropomorphic 3D-Printed Prosthetic Hand with Enhanced Dexterity for Typing Tasks

Despite recent advancements, existing prosthetic limbs are unable to replicate the dexterity and intuitive control of the human hand. Current control systems for prosthetic hands are often limited to grasping, and commercial prosthetic hands lack the precision needed for dexterous manipulation or applications that require fine finger motions. Thus, there is a critical need for accessible and replicable prosthetic designs that enable individuals to interact with electronic devices and perform precise finger pressing, such as keyboard typing or piano playing, while preserving current prosthetic capabilities. This paper presents a low-cost, lightweight, 3D-printed robotic prosthetic hand, specifically engineered for enhanced dexterity with electronic devices such as a computer keyboard or piano, as well as general object manipulation. The robotic hand features a mechanism to adjust finger abduction/adduction spacing, a 2-D wrist with the inclusion of controlled ulnar/radial deviation optimized for typing, and control of independent finger pressing. We conducted a study to demonstrate how participants can use the robotic hand to perform keyboard typing and piano playing in real time, with different levels of finger and wrist motion. This supports the notion that our proposed design can allow for the execution of key typing motions more effectively than before, aiming to enhance the functionality of prosthetic hands.

Deformable object manipulation (DOM) represents a critical challenge in robotics, with applications spanning healthcare, manufacturing, food processing, and beyond. Unlike rigid objects, deformable objects exhibit infinite dimensionality, dynamic shape changes, and complex interactions with their environment, posing significant hurdles for perception, modeling, and control. This paper reviews the state of the art in DOM, focusing on key challenges such as occlusion handling, task generalization, and scalable, real-time solutions. It highlights advancements in multimodal perception systems, including the integration of multi-camera setups, active vision, and tactile sensing, which collectively address occlusion and improve adaptability in unstructured environments. Cutting-edge developments in physically informed reinforcement learning (RL) and differentiable simulations are explored, showcasing their impact on efficiency, precision, and scalability. The review also emphasizes the potential of simulated expert demonstrations and generative neural networks to standardize task specifications and bridge the simulation-to-reality gap. Finally, future directions are proposed, including the adoption of graph neural networks for high-level decision-making and the creation of comprehensive datasets to enhance DOM's real-world applicability. By addressing these challenges, DOM research can pave the way for versatile robotic systems capable of handling diverse and dynamic tasks with deformable objects.

### Automated Robotic Needle Puncture for Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheostomy
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22952v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22952v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22952v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22952v1)

Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is frequently performed on patients in intensive care units for prolonged mechanical ventilation. The needle puncture, as the most critical step of PDT, could lead to adverse consequences such as major bleeding and posterior tracheal wall perforation if performed inaccurately. Current practices of PDT puncture are all performed manually with no navigation assistance, which leads to large position and angular errors (5 mm and 30 degree). To improve the accuracy and reduce the difficulty of the PDT procedure, we propose a system that automates the needle insertion using a velocity-controlled robotic manipulator. Guided using pose data from two electromagnetic sensors, one at the needle tip and the other inside the trachea, the robotic system uses an adaptive constrained controller to adapt the uncertain kinematic parameters online and avoid collisions with the patient's body and tissues near the target. Simulations were performed to validate the controller's implementation, and then four hundred PDT punctures were performed on a mannequin to evaluate the position and angular accuracy. The absolute median puncture position error was 1.7 mm (IQR: 1.9 mm) and midline deviation was 4.13 degree (IQR: 4.55 degree), measured by the sensor inside the trachea. The small deviations from the nominal puncture in a simulated experimental setup and formal guarantees of collision-free insertions suggest the feasibility of the robotic PDT puncture.

### Considering Perspectives for Automated Driving Ethics: Collective Risk in Vehicular Motion Planning

Recent automated vehicle (AV) motion planning strategies evolve around minimizing risk in road traffic. However, they exclusively consider risk from the AV's perspective and, as such, do not address the ethicality of its decisions for other road users. We argue that this does not reduce the risk of each road user, as risk may be different from the perspective of each road user. Indeed, minimizing the risk from the AV's perspective may not imply that the risk from the perspective of other road users is also being minimized; in fact, it may even increase. To test this hypothesis, we propose an AV motion planning strategy that supports switching risk minimization strategies between all road user perspectives. We find that the risk from the perspective of other road users can generally be considered different to the risk from the AV's perspective. Taking a collective risk perspective, i.e., balancing the risks of all road users, we observe an AV that minimizes overall traffic risk the best, while putting itself at slightly higher risk for the benefit of others, which is consistent with human driving behavior. In addition, adopting a collective risk minimization strategy can also be beneficial to the AV's travel efficiency by acting assertively when other road users maintain a low risk estimate of the AV. Yet, the AV drives conservatively when its planned actions are less predictable to other road users, i.e., associated with high risk. We argue that such behavior is a form of self-reflection and a natural prerequisite for socially acceptable AV behavior. We conclude that to facilitate ethicality in road traffic that includes AVs, the risk-perspective of each road user must be considered in the decision-making of AVs.

While autonomous navigation has achieved remarkable success in passive perception (e.g., object detection and segmentation), it remains fundamentally constrained by a void in knowledge-driven, interactive environmental cognition. In the high-stakes domain of maritime navigation, the ability to bridge the gap between raw visual perception and complex cognitive reasoning is not merely an enhancement but a critical prerequisite for Autonomous Surface Vessels to execute safe and precise maneuvers. To this end, we present WaterVideoQA, the first large-scale, comprehensive Video Question Answering benchmark specifically engineered for all-waterway environments. This benchmark encompasses 3,029 video clips across six distinct waterway categories, integrating multifaceted variables such as volatile lighting and dynamic weather to rigorously stress-test ASV capabilities across a five-tier hierarchical cognitive framework. Furthermore, we introduce NaviMind, a pioneering multi-agent neuro-symbolic system designed for open-ended maritime reasoning. By synergizing Adaptive Semantic Routing, Situation-Aware Hierarchical Reasoning, and Autonomous Self-Reflective Verification, NaviMind transitions ASVs from superficial pattern matching to regulation-compliant, interpretable decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly transcends existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for intelligent, trustworthy interaction in dynamic maritime environments.

Tuning active prostheses for people with amputation is time-consuming and relies on metrics that may not fully reflect user needs. We introduce a human-in-the-loop optimization (HILO) approach that leverages direct user preferences to personalize a standard four-parameter prosthesis controller efficiently. Our method employs preference-based Multiobjective Bayesian Optimization that uses a state-or-the-art acquisition function especially designed for preference learning, and includes two algorithmic variants: a discrete version (\textit{EUBO-LineCoSpar}), and a continuous version (\textit{BPE4Prost}). Simulation results on benchmark functions and real-application trials demonstrate efficient convergence, robust preference elicitation, and measurable biomechanical improvements, illustrating the potential of preference-driven tuning for user-centered prosthesis control.

### DySL-VLA: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Model Inference via Dynamic-Static Layer-Skipping for Robot Manipulation

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable success in robotic tasks like manipulation by fusing a language model's reasoning with a vision model's 3D understanding. However, their high computational cost remains a major obstacle for real-world applications that require real-time performance. We observe that the actions within a task have varying levels of importance: critical steps demand high precision, while less important ones can tolerate more variance. Leveraging this insight, we propose DySL-VLA, a novel framework that addresses computational cost by dynamically skipping VLA layers based on each action's importance. DySL-VLA categorizes its layers into two types: informative layers, which are consistently executed, and incremental layers, which can be selectively skipped. To intelligently skip layers without sacrificing accuracy, we invent a prior-post skipping guidance mechanism to determine when to initiate layer-skipping. We also propose a skip-aware two-stage knowledge distillation algorithm to efficiently train a standard VLA into a DySL-VLA. Our experiments indicate that DySL-VLA achieves 2.1% improvement in success length over Deer-VLA on the Calvin dataset, while simultaneously reducing trainable parameters by a factor of 85.7 and providing a 3.75x speedup relative to the RoboFlamingo baseline at iso-accuracy. Our code is available on https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/DYSL_VLA.

### GraspLDP: Towards Generalizable Grasping Policy via Latent Diffusion

This paper focuses on enhancing the grasping precision and generalization of manipulation policies learned via imitation learning. Diffusion-based policy learning methods have recently become the mainstream approach for robotic manipulation tasks. As grasping is a critical subtask in manipulation, the ability of imitation-learned policies to execute precise and generalizable grasps merits particular attention. Existing imitation learning techniques for grasping often suffer from imprecise grasp executions, limited spatial generalization, and poor object generalization. To address these challenges, we incorporate grasp prior knowledge into the diffusion policy framework. In particular, we employ a latent diffusion policy to guide action chunk decoding with grasp pose prior, ensuring that generated motion trajectories adhere closely to feasible grasp configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised reconstruction objective during diffusion to embed the graspness prior: at each reverse diffusion step, we reconstruct wrist-camera images back-projected the graspness from the intermediate representations. Both simulation and real robot experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods and exhibits strong dynamic grasping capabilities.

### Performance and Experimental Analysis of Strain-based Models for Continuum Robots
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22854v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22854v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22854v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22854v1)

Although strain-based models have been widely adopted in robotics, no comparison beyond the uniform bending test is commonly recognized to assess their performance. In addition, the increasing effort in prototyping continuum robots highlights the need to assess the applicability of these models and the necessity of comprehensive performance evaluation. To address this gap, this work investigates the shape reconstruction abilities of a third-order strain interpolation method, examining its ability to capture both individual and combined deformation effects. These results are compared and discussed against the Geometric-Variable Strain approach. Subsequently, simulation results are experimentally verified by reshaping a slender rod while recording the resulting configurations using cameras. The rod configuration is imposed using a manipulator displacing one of its tips and extracted through reflective markers, without the aid of any other external sensor -- i.e. strain gauges or wrench sensors placed along the rod. The experiments demonstrate good agreement between the model predictions and observed shapes, with average error of 0.58% of the rod length and average computational time of 0.32s per configuration, outperforming existing models.

Robotics is undergoing a significant transformation powered by advances in high-level control techniques based on machine learning, giving rise to the field of robot learning. Recent progress in robot learning has been accelerated by the increasing availability of affordable teleoperation systems, large-scale openly available datasets, and scalable learning-based methods. However, development in the field of robot learning is often slowed by fragmented, closed-source tools designed to only address specific sub-components within the robotics stack. In this paper, we present \texttt{lerobot}, an open-source library that integrates across the entire robot learning stack, from low-level middleware communication for motor controls to large-scale dataset collection, storage and streaming. The library is designed with a strong focus on real-world robotics, supporting accessible hardware platforms while remaining extensible to new embodiments. It also supports efficient implementations for various state-of-the-art robot learning algorithms from multiple prominent paradigms, as well as a generalized asynchronous inference stack. Unlike traditional pipelines which heavily rely on hand-crafted techniques, \texttt{lerobot} emphasizes scalable learning approaches that improve directly with more data and compute. Designed for accessibility, scalability, and openness, \texttt{lerobot} lowers the barrier to entry for researchers and practitioners to robotics while providing a platform for reproducible, state-of-the-art robot learning.

### Unleashing the Potential of Diffusion Models for End-to-End Autonomous Driving

Diffusion models have become a popular choice for decision-making tasks in robotics, and more recently, are also being considered for solving autonomous driving tasks. However, their applications and evaluations in autonomous driving remain limited to simulation-based or laboratory settings. The full strength of diffusion models for large-scale, complex real-world settings, such as End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E AD), remains underexplored. In this study, we conducted a systematic and large-scale investigation to unleash the potential of the diffusion models as planners for E2E AD, based on a tremendous amount of real-vehicle data and road testing. Through comprehensive and carefully controlled studies, we identify key insights into the diffusion loss space, trajectory representation, and data scaling that significantly impact E2E planning performance. Moreover, we also provide an effective reinforcement learning post-training strategy to further enhance the safety of the learned planner. The resulting diffusion-based learning framework, Hyper Diffusion Planner} (HDP), is deployed on a real-vehicle platform and evaluated across 6 urban driving scenarios and 200 km of real-world testing, achieving a notable 10x performance improvement over the base model. Our work demonstrates that diffusion models, when properly designed and trained, can serve as effective and scalable E2E AD planners for complex, real-world autonomous driving tasks.

### Pixel2Catch: Multi-Agent Sim-to-Real Transfer for Agile Manipulation with a Single RGB Camera

To catch a thrown object, a robot must be able to perceive the object's motion and generate control actions in a timely manner. Rather than explicitly estimating the object's 3D position, this work focuses on a novel approach that recognizes object motion using pixel-level visual information extracted from a single RGB image. Such visual cues capture changes in the object's position and scale, allowing the policy to reason about the object's motion. Furthermore, to achieve stable learning in a high-DoF system composed of a robot arm equipped with a multi-fingered hand, we design a heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that defines the arm and hand as independent agents with distinct roles. Each agent is trained cooperatively using role-specific observations and rewards, and the learned policies are successfully transferred from simulation to the real world.

### Sapling-NeRF: Geo-Localised Sapling Reconstruction in Forests for Ecological Monitoring

Saplings are key indicators of forest regeneration and overall forest health. However, their fine-scale architectural traits are difficult to capture with existing 3D sensing methods, which make quantitative evaluation difficult. Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS), Mobile Laser Scanners (MLS), or traditional photogrammetry approaches poorly reconstruct thin branches, dense foliage, and lack the scale consistency needed for long-term monitoring. Implicit 3D reconstruction methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are promising alternatives, but cannot recover the true scale of a scene and lack any means to be accurately geo-localised. In this paper, we present a pipeline which fuses NeRF, LiDAR SLAM, and GNSS to enable repeatable, geo-localised ecological monitoring of saplings. Our system proposes a three-level representation: (i) coarse Earth-frame localisation using GNSS, (ii) LiDAR-based SLAM for centimetre-accurate localisation and reconstruction, and (iii) NeRF-derived object-centric dense reconstruction of individual saplings. This approach enables repeatable quantitative evaluation and long-term monitoring of sapling traits. Our experiments in forest plots in Wytham Woods (Oxford, UK) and Evo (Finland) show that stem height, branching patterns, and leaf-to-wood ratios can be captured with increased accuracy as compared to TLS. We demonstrate that accurate stem skeletons and leaf distributions can be measured for saplings with heights between 0.5m and 2m in situ, giving ecologists access to richer structural and quantitative data for analysing forest dynamics.

### Robust Helicopter Ship Deck Landing With Guaranteed Timing Using Shrinking-Horizon Model Predictive Control
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22714v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.22714v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22714v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.22714v1)

2026/02/26 07:40 GTM

We present a runtime efficient algorithm for autonomous helicopter landings on moving ship decks based on Shrinking-Horizon Model Predictive Control (SHMPC). First, a suitable planning model capturing the relevant aspects of the full nonlinear helicopter dynamics is derived. Next, we use the SHMPC together with a touchdown controller stage to ensure a pre-specified maneuver time and an associated landing time window despite the presence of disturbances. A high disturbance rejection performance is achieved by designing an ancillary controller with disturbance feedback. Thus, given a target position and time, a safe landing with suitable terminal conditions is be guaranteed if the initial optimization problem is feasible. The efficacy of our approach is shown in simulation where all maneuvers achieve a high landing precision in strong winds while satisfying timing and operational constraints with maximum computation times in the millisecond range.

### SCOPE: Skeleton Graph-Based Computation-Efficient Framework for Autonomous UAV Exploration

Autonomous exploration in unknown environments is key for mobile robots, helping them perceive, map, and make decisions in complex areas. However, current methods often rely on frequent global optimization, suffering from high computational latency and trajectory oscillation, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, we propose SCOPE, a novel framework that incrementally constructs a real-time skeletal graph and introduces Implicit Unknown Region Analysis for efficient spatial reasoning. The planning layer adopts a hierarchical on-demand strategy: the Proximal Planner generates smooth, high-frequency local trajectories, while the Region-Sequence Planner is activated only when necessary to optimize global visitation order. Comparative evaluations in simulation demonstrate that SCOPE achieves competitive exploration performance comparable to state-of-the-art global planners, while reducing computational cost by an average of 86.9%. Real-world experiments further validate the system's robustness and low latency in practical scenarios.

Carsickness has gained significant attention with the rise of automated vehicles, prompting extensive research across on-road, test-track, and driving simulator environments to understand its occurrence and develop mitigation strategies. However, the lack of carsickness standardization complicates comparisons across studies and environments. Previous works demonstrate measurement validity between two setups at most (e.g., on-road vs. driving simulator), leaving gaps in multi-environment comparisons. This study investigates the recreation of an on-road motion sickness exposure - previously replicated on a test track - using a motion-based driving simulator. Twenty-eight participants performed an eyes-off-road non-driving task while reporting motion sickness using the Misery Scale during the experiment and the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire afterward. Psychological factors known to influence motion sickness were also assessed. The results present subjective and objective measurements for motion sickness across the considered environments. In this paper, acceleration measurements, objective metrics and subjective motion sickness ratings across environments are compared, highlighting key differences in sickness occurrence for simulator-based research validity. Significantly lower motion sickness scores are reported in the simulator compared to on-road and test-track conditions, due to its limited working envelope to reproduce low-frequency (<0.5 Hz) motions, which are the most provocative for motion sickness.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a generalist robotic agent. However, existing VLAs are hindered by excessive parameter scales, prohibitive pre-training requirements, and limited applicability to diverse embodiments. To improve the practicality of VLAs, we propose a comprehensive benchmark and an improved baseline. First, we propose CEBench, a new benchmark spanning diverse embodiments in both simulation and the real world with consideration of domain randomization. We collect 14.4k simulated trajectories and 1.6k real-world expert-curated trajectories to support training on CEBench. Second, using CEBench as our testbed, we study three critical aspects of VLAs' practicality and offer several key findings. Informed by these findings, we introduce LLaVA-VLA, a lightweight yet powerful VLA designed for practical deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. Architecturally, it integrates a compact VLM backbone with multi-view perception, proprioceptive tokenization, and action chunking. To eliminate reliance on costly pre-training, LLaVA-VLA adopts a two-stage training paradigm including post-training and fine-tuning. Furthermore, LLaVA-VLA extends the action space to unify navigation and manipulation. Experiments across embodiments demonstrate the capabilities of generalization and versatility of LLaVA-VLA , while real-world mobile manipulation experiments establish it as the first end-to-end VLA model for mobile manipulation. We will open-source all datasets, codes, and checkpoints upon acceptance to foster reproducibility and future research.
