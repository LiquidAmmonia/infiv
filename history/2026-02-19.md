### TeCoNeRV: Leveraging Temporal Coherence for Compressible Neural Representations for Videos
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16711v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16711v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16711v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16711v1)

Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance for video compression. However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\times$ faster encoding speeds. With our low memory usage, we are the first hypernetwork approach to demonstrate results at 480p, 720p and 1080p on UVG, HEVC and MCL-JCV.

### Learning Humanoid End-Effector Control for Open-Vocabulary Visual Loco-Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16705v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16705v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16705v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16705v1)

Visual loco-manipulation of arbitrary objects in the wild with humanoid robots requires accurate end-effector (EE) control and a generalizable understanding of the scene via visual inputs (e.g., RGB-D images). Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects.

### Saliency-Aware Multi-Route Thinking: Revisiting Vision-Language Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16702v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16702v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16702v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16702v1)

Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.

### Are Object-Centric Representations Better At Compositional Generalization?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16689v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16689v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16689v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16689v1)

2026/02/18 18:34 GTM

Compositional generalization, the ability to reason about novel combinations of familiar concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and a critical challenge for machine learning. Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.

### Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16682v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16682v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16682v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16682v1)

A core aspect of human perception is situated awareness, the ability to relate ourselves to the surrounding physical environment and reason over possible actions in context. However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.

### VETime: Vision Enhanced Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16681v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16681v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16681v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16681v1)

2026/02/18 18:22 GTM

Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) requires identifying both immediate Point Anomalies and long-range Context Anomalies. However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

### PredMapNet: Future and Historical Reasoning for Consistent Online HD Vectorized Map Construction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16669v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16669v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16669v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16669v1)

High-definition (HD) maps are crucial to autonomous driving, providing structured representations of road elements to support navigation and planning. However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with good efficiency.

### Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation via a Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16664v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16664v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16664v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16664v1)

2026/02/18 18:05 GTM

Adversarial diffusion and diffusion-inversion methods have advanced unpaired image-to-image translation, but each faces key limitations. Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.

### Style-Aware Gloss Control for Generative Non-Photorealistic Rendering
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16611v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16611v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16611v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16611v1)

Humans can infer material characteristics of objects from their visual appearance, and this ability extends to artistic depictions, where similar perceptual strategies guide the interpretation of paintings or drawings. Among the factors that define material appearance, gloss, along with color, is widely regarded as one of the most important, and recent studies indicate that humans can perceive gloss independently of the artistic style used to depict an object. To investigate how gloss and artistic style are represented in learned models, we train an unsupervised generative model on a newly curated dataset of painterly objects designed to systematically vary such factors. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical latent space in which gloss is disentangled from other appearance factors, allowing for a detailed study of how gloss is represented and varies across artistic styles. Building on this representation, we introduce a lightweight adapter that connects our style- and gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of non-photorealistic images with fine-grained control of these factors. We compare our approach with previous models and observe improved disentanglement and controllability of the learned factors.

### Explainable AI: Context-Aware Layer-Wise Integrated Gradients for Explaining Transformer Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16608v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16608v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16608v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16608v1)

2026/02/18 17:03 GTM

Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains and tasks, yet their deeply layered representations make their predictions difficult to interpret. Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models.

### A Contrastive Learning Framework Empowered by Attention-based Feature Adaptation for Street-View Image Classification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16590v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16590v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16590v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16590v1)

2026/02/18 16:41 GTM

Street-view image attribute classification is a vital downstream task of image classification, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, urban analytics, and high-definition map construction. It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/CLIP-MHAdapter.

### Arc2Morph: Identity-Preserving Facial Morphing with Arc2Face
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16569v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16569v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16569v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16569v1)

2026/02/18 16:11 GTM

Face morphing attacks are widely recognized as one of the most challenging threats to face recognition systems used in electronic identity documents. These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process.

### Let's Split Up: Zero-Shot Classifier Edits for Fine-Grained Video Understanding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16545v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16545v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16545v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16545v1)

Video recognition models are typically trained on fixed taxonomies which are often too coarse, collapsing distinctions in object, manner or outcome under a single label. As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

### DressWild: Feed-Forward Pose-Agnostic Garment Sewing Pattern Generation from In-the-Wild Images
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16502v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16502v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16502v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16502v1)

Recent advances in garment pattern generation have shown promising progress. However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.

### Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness and Adversarial Training Strategies for Object Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16494v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16494v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16494v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16494v1)

Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.

### MMA: Multimodal Memory Agent
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16493v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16493v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16493v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16493v1)

2026/02/18 14:30 GTM

Long-horizon multimodal agents depend on external memory; however, similarity-based retrieval often surfaces stale, low-credibility, or conflicting items, which can trigger overconfident errors. We propose Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which assigns each retrieved memory item a dynamic reliability score by combining source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus, and uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. We also introduce MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the "Visual Placebo Effect", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench, MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.

### Visual Self-Refine: A Pixel-Guided Paradigm for Accurate Chart Parsing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16455v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16455v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16455v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16455v1)

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reasoning and self-correction at the textual level, these strengths provide minimal benefits for complex tasks centered on visual perception, such as Chart Parsing. Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing. Our work also highlights VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism, offering a promising new direction for enhancing accuracy on a wide range of vision-centric tasks.

### Designing Production-Scale OCR for India: Multilingual and Domain-Specific Systems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16430v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16430v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16430v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16430v1)

Designing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems for India requires balancing linguistic diversity, document heterogeneity, and deployment constraints. In this paper, we study two training strategies for building multilingual OCR systems with Vision-Language Models through the Chitrapathak series. We first follow a popular multimodal approach, pairing a generic vision encoder with a strong multilingual language model and training the system end-to-end for OCR. Alternatively, we explore fine-tuning an existing OCR model, despite not being trained for the target languages. Through extensive evaluation on multilingual Indic OCR benchmarks and deployment-oriented metrics, we find that the second strategy consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs. Chitrapathak-2 achieves 3-6x speedup over its predecessor with being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in Telugu (6.69 char ANLS) and second best in the rest. In addition, we present Parichay, an independent OCR model series designed specifically for 9 Indian government documents to extract structured key fields, achieving 89.8% Exact Match score with a faster inference. Together, these systems achieve SOTA performance and provide practical guidance for building production-scale OCR pipelines in the Indian context.

### Automated Histopathology Report Generation via Pyramidal Feature Extraction and the UNI Foundation Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16422v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16422v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16422v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16422v1)

Generating diagnostic text from histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is challenging due to the gigapixel scale of the input and the requirement for precise, domain specific language. We propose a hierarchical vision language framework that combines a frozen pathology foundation model with a Transformer decoder for report generation. To make WSI processing tractable, we perform multi resolution pyramidal patch selection (downsampling factors 2^3 to 2^6) and remove background and artifacts using Laplacian variance and HSV based criteria. Patch features are extracted with the UNI Vision Transformer and projected to a 6 layer Transformer decoder that generates diagnostic text via cross attention. To better represent biomedical terminology, we tokenize the output using BioGPT. Finally, we add a retrieval based verification step that compares generated reports with a reference corpus using Sentence BERT embeddings; if a high similarity match is found, the generated report is replaced with the retrieved ground truth reference to improve reliability.

### ReMoRa: Multimodal Large Language Model based on Refined Motion Representation for Long-Video Understanding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16412v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16412v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16412v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16412v1)

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, long-form video understanding remains a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.

### Parameter-Free Adaptive Multi-Scale Channel-Spatial Attention Aggregation framework for 3D Indoor Semantic Scene Completion Toward Assisting Visually Impaired

In indoor assistive perception for visually impaired users, 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is expected to provide structurally coherent and semantically consistent occupancy under strictly monocular vision for safety-critical scene understanding. However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.

### Markerless 6D Pose Estimation and Position-Based Visual Servoing for Endoscopic Continuum Manipulators
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16365v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16365v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16365v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16365v1)

Continuum manipulators in flexible endoscopic surgical systems offer high dexterity for minimally invasive procedures; however, accurate pose estimation and closed-loop control remain challenging due to hysteresis, compliance, and limited distal sensing. Vision-based approaches reduce hardware complexity but are often constrained by limited geometric observability and high computational overhead, restricting real-time closed-loop applicability. This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing.

### Articulated 3D Scene Graphs for Open-World Mobile Manipulation

Semantics has enabled 3D scene understanding and affordance-driven object interaction. However, robots operating in real-world environments face a critical limitation: they cannot anticipate how objects move. Long-horizon mobile manipulation requires closing the gap between semantics, geometry, and kinematics. In this work, we present MoMa-SG, a novel framework for building semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs of articulated scenes containing a myriad of interactable objects. Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach. In addition, real-world experiments on both a quadruped and a mobile manipulator demonstrate that our semantic-kinematic scene graphs enable robust manipulation of articulated objects in everyday home environments. We provide code and data at: https://momasg.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### SCAR: Satellite Imagery-Based Calibration for Aerial Recordings
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16349v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16349v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16349v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16349v1)

2026/02/18 10:33 GTM

We introduce SCAR, a method for long-term auto-calibration refinement of aerial visual-inertial systems that exploits georeferenced satellite imagery as a persistent global reference. SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention.

### Subtractive Modulative Network with Learnable Periodic Activations

2026/02/18 10:20 GTM

We propose the Subtractive Modulative Network (SMN), a novel, parameter-efficient Implicit Neural Representation (INR) architecture inspired by classical subtractive synthesis. The SMN is designed as a principled signal processing pipeline, featuring a learnable periodic activation layer (Oscillator) that generates a multi-frequency basis, and a series of modulative mask modules (Filters) that actively generate high-order harmonics. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical validation for our design. Our SMN achieves a PSNR of $40+$ dB on two image datasets, comparing favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and parameter efficiency. Furthermore, consistent advantage is observed on the challenging 3D NeRF novel view synthesis task. Supplementary materials are available at https://inrainbws.github.io/smn/.

### Guide-Guard: Off-Target Predicting in CRISPR Applications

With the introduction of cyber-physical genome sequencing and editing technologies, such as CRISPR, researchers can more easily access tools to investigate and create remedies for a variety of topics in genetics and health science (e.g. agriculture and medicine). As the field advances and grows, new concerns present themselves in the ability to predict the off-target behavior. In this work, we explore the underlying biological and chemical model from a data driven perspective. Additionally, we present a machine learning based solution named \textit{Guide-Guard} to predict the behavior of the system given a gRNA in the CRISPR gene-editing process with 84\% accuracy. This solution is able to be trained on multiple different genes at the same time while retaining accuracy.

### A Self-Supervised Approach for Enhanced Feature Representations in Object Detection Tasks

In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence, where models are increasingly growing in complexity and size, the availability of labeled data for training deep learning models has become a significant challenge. Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.

### RefineFormer3D: Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation via Adaptive Multi-Scale Transformer with Cross Attention Fusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16320v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16320v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16320v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16320v1)

Accurate and computationally efficient 3D medical image segmentation remains a critical challenge in clinical workflows. Transformer-based architectures often demonstrate superior global contextual modeling but at the expense of excessive parameter counts and memory demands, restricting their clinical deployment. We propose RefineFormer3D, a lightweight hierarchical transformer architecture that balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency for volumetric medical imaging. The architecture integrates three key components: (i) GhostConv3D-based patch embedding for efficient feature extraction with minimal redundancy, (ii) MixFFN3D module with low-rank projections and depthwise convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, and (iii) a cross-attention fusion decoder enabling adaptive multi-scale skip connection integration. RefineFormer3D contains only 2.94M parameters, substantially fewer than contemporary transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments on ACDC and BraTS benchmarks demonstrate that RefineFormer3D achieves 93.44\% and 85.9\% average Dice scores respectively, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, the model achieves fast inference (8.35 ms per volume on GPU) with low memory requirements, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish RefineFormer3D as an effective and scalable solution for practical 3D medical image segmentation.

### Breaking the Sub-Millimeter Barrier: Eyeframe Acquisition from Color Images
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16281v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16281v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16281v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16281v1)

Eyeframe lens tracing is an important process in the optical industry that requires sub-millimeter precision to ensure proper lens fitting and optimal vision correction. Traditional frame tracers rely on mechanical tools that need precise positioning and calibration, which are time-consuming and require additional equipment, creating an inefficient workflow for opticians. This work presents a novel approach based on artificial vision that utilizes multi-view information. The proposed algorithm operates on images captured from an InVision system. The full pipeline includes image acquisition, frame segmentation to isolate the eyeframe from background, depth estimation to obtain 3D spatial information, and multi-view processing that integrates segmented RGB images with depth data for precise frame contour measurement. To this end, different configurations and variants are proposed and analyzed on real data, providing competitive measurements from still color images with respect to other solutions, while eliminating the need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians.

### AFFMAE: Scalable and Efficient Vision Pretraining for Desktop Graphics Cards
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16249v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16249v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16249v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16249v1)

Self-supervised pretraining has transformed computer vision by enabling data-efficient fine-tuning, yet high-resolution training typically requires server-scale infrastructure, limiting in-domain foundation model development for many research laboratories. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) reduce computation by encoding only visible tokens, but combining MAE with hierarchical downsampling architectures remains structurally challenging due to dense grid priors and mask-aware design compromises. We introduce AFFMAE, a masking-friendly hierarchical pretraining framework built on adaptive, off-grid token merging. By discarding masked tokens and performing dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, AFFMAE removes dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. We developed numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels, and mitigate sparse-stage representation collapse via deep supervision. On high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, AFFMAE matches ViT-MAE performance at equal parameter count while reducing FLOPs by up to 7x, halving memory usage, and achieving faster training on a single RTX 5090.

### HyPCA-Net: Advancing Multimodal Fusion in Medical Image Analysis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16245v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16245v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16245v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16245v1)

2026/02/18 07:47 GTM

Multimodal fusion frameworks, which integrate diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT), have shown great potential in applications such as skin cancer detection, dementia diagnosis, and brain tumor prediction. However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

### EasyControlEdge: A Foundation-Model Fine-Tuning for Edge Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16238v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16238v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16238v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16238v1)

2026/02/18 07:28 GTM

We propose EasyControlEdge, adapting an image-generation foundation model to edge detection. In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale. Experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa compare against state-of-the-art methods and show consistent gains, particularly under no-post-processing crispness evaluation and with limited training data.

Large-scale video repositories are increasingly available for modern video understanding and generation tasks. However, transforming raw videos into high-quality, task-specific datasets remains costly and inefficient. We present DataCube, an intelligent platform for automatic video processing, multi-dimensional profiling, and query-driven retrieval. DataCube constructs structured semantic representations of video clips and supports hybrid retrieval with neural re-ranking and deep semantic matching. Through an interactive web interface, users can efficiently construct customized video subsets from massive repositories for training, analysis, and evaluation, and build searchable systems over their own private video collections. The system is publicly accessible at https://datacube.baai.ac.cn/.

### Graph neural network for colliding particles with an application to sea ice floe modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16213v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16213v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16213v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16213v1)

This paper introduces a novel approach to sea ice modeling using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), utilizing the natural graph structure of sea ice, where nodes represent individual ice pieces, and edges model the physical interactions, including collisions. This concept is developed within a one-dimensional framework as a foundational step. Traditional numerical methods, while effective, are computationally intensive and less scalable. By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling.

### Reinforced Fast Weights with Next-Sequence Prediction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16704v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16704v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16704v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16704v1)

Fast weight architectures offer a promising alternative to attention-based transformers for long-context modeling by maintaining constant memory overhead regardless of context length. However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following a prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures.

### Calibrate-Then-Act: Cost-Aware Exploration in LLM Agents

LLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in a single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies.

### Scaling Open Discrete Audio Foundation Models with Interleaved Semantic, Acoustic, and Text Tokens

Current audio language models are predominantly text-first, either extending pre-trained text LLM backbones or relying on semantic-only audio tokens, limiting general audio modeling. This paper presents a systematic empirical study of native audio foundation models that apply next-token prediction to audio at scale, jointly modeling semantic content, acoustic details, and text to support both general audio generation and cross-modal capabilities. We provide comprehensive empirical insights for building such models: (1) We systematically investigate design choices -- data sources, text mixture ratios, and token composition -- establishing a validated training recipe. (2) We conduct the first scaling law study for discrete audio models via IsoFLOP analysis on 64 models spanning $3{\times}10^{18}$ to $3{\times}10^{20}$ FLOPs, finding that optimal data grows 1.6$\times$ faster than optimal model size. (3) We apply these lessons to train SODA (Scaling Open Discrete Audio), a suite of models from 135M to 4B parameters on 500B tokens, comparing against our scaling predictions and existing models. SODA serves as a flexible backbone for diverse audio/text tasks -- we demonstrate this by fine-tuning for voice-preserving speech-to-speech translation, using the same unified architecture.

### Align Once, Benefit Multilingually: Enforcing Multilingual Consistency for LLM Safety Alignment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16660v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16660v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16660v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16660v1)

The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across linguistic communities necessitates reliable multilingual safety alignment. However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision.

### Quecto-V1: Empirical Analysis of 8-bit Quantized Small Language Models for On-Device Legal Retrieval
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16640v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16640v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16640v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16640v1)

The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has simultaneously created a "resource divide." State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes "lexical density" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.

### AREG: Adversarial Resource Extraction Game for Evaluating Persuasion and Resistance in Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16639v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16639v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16639v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16639v1)

2026/02/18 17:28 GTM

Evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly requires moving beyond static text generation toward dynamic, adversarial interaction. We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.

### Who can we trust? LLM-as-a-jury for Comparative Assessment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16610v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16610v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16610v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16610v1)

2026/02/18 17:04 GTM

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied as automatic evaluators for natural language generation assessment often using pairwise comparative judgements. Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability. In practice, LLM judges vary substantially in performance across tasks and aspects, and their judgment probabilities may be biased and inconsistent. Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability.

### ColBERT-Zero: To Pre-train Or Not To Pre-train ColBERT models

Current state-of-the-art multi-vector models are obtained through a small Knowledge Distillation (KD) training step on top of strong single-vector models, leveraging the large-scale pre-training of these models. In this paper, we study the pre-training of multi-vector models and show that large-scale multi-vector pre-training yields much stronger multi-vector models. Notably, a fully ColBERT-pre-trained model, ColBERT-Zero, trained only on public data, outperforms GTE-ModernColBERT as well as its base model, GTE-ModernBERT, which leverages closed and much stronger data, setting new state-of-the-art for model this size. We also find that, although performing only a small KD step is not enough to achieve results close to full pre-training, adding a supervised step beforehand allows to achieve much closer performance while skipping the most costly unsupervised phase. Finally, we find that aligning the fine-tuning and pre-training setups is crucial when repurposing existing models. To enable exploration of our results, we release various checkpoints as well as code used to train them.

### Explainable AI: Context-Aware Layer-Wise Integrated Gradients for Explaining Transformer Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16608v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16608v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16608v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16608v1)

Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains and tasks, yet their deeply layered representations make their predictions difficult to interpret. Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models.

### CitiLink-Summ: Summarization of Discussion Subjects in European Portuguese Municipal Meeting Minutes

Municipal meeting minutes are formal records documenting the discussions and decisions of local government, yet their content is often lengthy, dense, and difficult for citizens to navigate. Automatic summarization can help address this challenge by producing concise summaries for each discussion subject. Despite its potential, research on summarizing discussion subjects in municipal meeting minutes remains largely unexplored, especially in low-resource languages, where the inherent complexity of these documents adds further challenges. A major bottleneck is the scarcity of datasets containing high-quality, manually crafted summaries, which limits the development and evaluation of effective summarization models for this domain. In this paper, we present CitiLink-Summ, a new corpus of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes, comprising 100 documents and 2,322 manually hand-written summaries, each corresponding to a distinct discussion subject. Leveraging this dataset, we establish baseline results for automatic summarization in this domain, employing state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., BART, PRIMERA) as well as large language models (LLMs), evaluated with both lexical and semantic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore. CitiLink-Summ provides the first benchmark for municipal-domain summarization in European Portuguese, offering a valuable resource for advancing NLP research on complex administrative texts.

### Creating a digital poet

Can a machine write good poetry? Any positive answer raises fundamental questions about the nature and value of art. We report a seven-month poetry workshop in which a large language model was shaped into a digital poet through iterative in-context expert feedback, without retraining. Across sessions, the model developed a distinctive style and a coherent corpus, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses, and it produced a pen name and author image. In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%. After the workshop, a commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model. These results show that workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping and renew debates on creativity and authorship.

### Utility-Preserving De-Identification for Math Tutoring: Investigating Numeric Ambiguity in the MathEd-PII Benchmark Dataset
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16571v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16571v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16571v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16571v1)

Large-scale sharing of dialogue-based data is instrumental for advancing the science of teaching and learning, yet rigorous de-identification remains a major barrier. In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the "numeric ambiguity" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling.

### Supercharging Agenda Setting Research: The ParlaCAP Dataset of 28 European Parliaments and a Scalable Multilingual LLM-Based Classification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16516v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16516v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16516v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16516v1)

This paper introduces ParlaCAP, a large-scale dataset for analyzing parliamentary agenda setting across Europe, and proposes a cost-effective method for building domain-specific policy topic classifiers. Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention.

### Optimizing Soft Prompt Tuning via Structural Evolution
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16500v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16500v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16500v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16500v1)

Soft prompt tuning leverages continuous embeddings to capture task-specific information in large pre-trained language models (LLMs), achieving competitive performance in few-shot settings. However, soft prompts rely on high-dimensional, implicit representations and lack explicit semantics and traceable training behaviors, which limits their interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose a soft prompt tuning optimization method based on topological morphological evolution. Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss). TSLoss guides the model to learn structurally stable adaptations by quantifying inter-parameter connectivity and redundancy. Extensive experiments show that training with TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance, providing an interpretable method to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning from structural and topological perspectives.

### From Growing to Looping: A Unified View of Iterative Computation in LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16490v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16490v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16490v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16490v1)

2026/02/18 14:25 GTM

Looping, reusing a block of layers across depth, and depth growing, training shallow-to-deep models by duplicating middle layers, have both been linked to stronger reasoning, but their relationship remains unclear. We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning.

### Learning to Learn from Language Feedback with Social Meta-Learning

Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to learn from corrective feedback within a conversational context. They are rarely proactive in soliciting this feedback, even when faced with ambiguity, which can make their dialogues feel static, one-sided, and lacking the adaptive qualities of human conversation. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need. This work presents a scalable approach to developing AI systems that effectively learn from language feedback.

### Team of Thoughts: Efficient Test-time Scaling of Agentic Systems through Orchestrated Tool Calling

Existing Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) typically rely on static, homogeneous model configurations, limiting their ability to exploit the distinct strengths of differently post-trained models. To address this, we introduce Team-of-Thoughts, a novel MAS architecture that leverages the complementary capabilities of heterogeneous agents via an orchestrator-tool paradigm. Our framework introduces two key mechanisms to optimize performance: (1) an orchestrator calibration scheme that identifies models with superior coordination capabilities, and (2) a self-assessment protocol where tool agents profile their own domain expertise to account for variations in post-training skills. During inference, the orchestrator dynamically activates the most suitable tool agents based on these proficiency profiles. Experiments on five reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that Team-of-Thoughts delivers consistently superior task performance. Notably, on AIME24 and LiveCodeBench, our approach achieves accuracies of 96.67% and 72.53%, respectively, substantially outperforming homogeneous role-play baselines, which score 80% and 65.93%.

### Training Models on Dialects of Translationese Shows How Lexical Diversity and Source-Target Syntactic Similarity Shape Learning

Machine-translated data is widely used in multilingual NLP, particularly when native text is scarce. However, translated text differs systematically from native text. This phenomenon is known as translationese, and it reflects both traces of the source language and characteristic properties of translation itself. In this paper, we study how training on machine-translated data affects small English language models, focusing on how translationese from different source languages shapes linguistic acceptability judgments and language modelling for different domains. We train models on English text translated from 24 typologically and resource-diverse source languages, enabling a systematic analysis of how source language and corpus properties influence what models learn. Our results show that the source language has a clear impact on model behavior: general perplexity is more driven by the lexical diversity of the translated corpus, while grammatical performance is strongly correlated to typological similarity to English, given enough data.

### IndicEval: A Bilingual Indian Educational Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates evaluation frameworks that reflect real-world academic rigor and multilingual complexity. This paper introduces IndicEval, a scalable benchmarking platform designed to assess LLM performance using authentic high-stakes examination questions from UPSC, JEE, and NEET across STEM and humanities domains in both English and Hindi. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, IndicEval grounds evaluation in real examination standards, enabling realistic measurement of reasoning, domain knowledge, and bilingual adaptability. The framework automates assessment using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies and supports modular integration of new models and languages. Experiments conducted on Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA 3-70B reveal three major findings. First, CoT prompting consistently improves reasoning accuracy, with substantial gains across subjects and languages. Second, significant cross-model performance disparities persist, particularly in high-complexity examinations. Third, multilingual degradation remains a critical challenge, with marked accuracy drops in Hindi compared to English, especially under Zero-Shot conditions. These results highlight persistent gaps in bilingual reasoning and domain transfer. Overall, IndicEval provides a practice-oriented, extensible foundation for rigorous, equitable evaluation of LLMs in multilingual educational settings and offers actionable insights for improving reasoning robustness and language adaptability.

### TabAgent: A Framework for Replacing Agentic Generative Components with Tabular-Textual Classifiers

Agentic systems, AI architectures that autonomously execute multi-step workflows to achieve complex goals, are often built using repeated large language model (LLM) calls for closed-set decision tasks such as routing, shortlisting, gating, and verification. While convenient, this design makes deployments slow and expensive due to cumulative latency and token usage. We propose TabAgent, a framework for replacing generative decision components in closed-set selection tasks with a compact textual-tabular classifier trained on execution traces. TabAgent (i) extracts structured schema, state, and dependency features from trajectories (TabSchema), (ii) augments coverage with schema-aligned synthetic supervision (TabSynth), and (iii) scores candidates with a lightweight classifier (TabHead). On the long-horizon AppWorld benchmark, TabAgent maintains task-level success while eliminating shortlist-time LLM calls, reducing latency by approximately 95% and inference cost by 85-91%. Beyond tool shortlisting, TabAgent generalizes to other agentic decision heads, establishing a paradigm for learned discriminative replacements of generative bottlenecks in production agent architectures.

### Label-Consistent Data Generation for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Using LLM Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16379v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16379v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16379v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16379v1)

We propose an agentic data augmentation method for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) that uses iterative generation and verification to produce high quality synthetic training examples. To isolate the effect of agentic structure, we also develop a closely matched prompting-based baseline using the same model and instructions. Both methods are evaluated across three ABSA subtasks (Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), Aspect Sentiment Classification (ATSC), and Aspect Sentiment Pair Extraction (ASPE)), four SemEval datasets, and two encoder-decoder models: T5-Base and Tk-Instruct. Our results show that the agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting in label preservation of the augmented data, especially when the tasks require aspect term generation. In addition, when combined with real data, agentic augmentation provides higher gains, consistently outperforming prompting-based generation. These benefits are most pronounced for T5-Base, while the more heavily pretrained Tk-Instruct exhibits smaller improvements. As a result, augmented data helps T5-Base achieve comparable performance with its counterpart.

### Variable-Length Semantic IDs for Recommender Systems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16375v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16375v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16375v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16375v1)

Generative models are increasingly used in recommender systems, both for modeling user behavior as event sequences and for integrating large language models into recommendation pipelines. A key challenge in this setting is the extremely large cardinality of item spaces, which makes training generative models difficult and introduces a vocabulary gap between natural language and item identifiers. Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem.
  However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems.
  In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation. We propose a discrete variational autoencoder with Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization that learns item representations of adaptive length under a principled probabilistic framework, avoiding the instability of REINFORCE-based training and the fixed-length constraints of prior semantic ID methods.

### Helpful to a Fault: Measuring Illicit Assistance in Multi-Turn, Multilingual LLM Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16346v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16346v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16346v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16346v1)

LLM-based agents execute real-world workflows via tools and memory. These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual.

### MemoryArena: Benchmarking Agent Memory in Interdependent Multi-Session Agentic Tasks

Existing evaluations of agents with memory typically assess memorization and action in isolation. One class of benchmarks evaluates memorization by testing recall of past conversations or text but fails to capture how memory is used to guide future decisions. Another class focuses on agents acting in single-session tasks without the need for long-term memory. However, in realistic settings, memorization and action are tightly coupled: agents acquire memory while interacting with the environment, and subsequently rely on that memory to solve future tasks. To capture this setting, we introduce MemoryArena, a unified evaluation gym for benchmarking agent memory in multi-session Memory-Agent-Environment loops. The benchmark consists of human-crafted agentic tasks with explicitly interdependent subtasks, where agents must learn from earlier actions and feedback by distilling experiences into memory, and subsequently use that memory to guide later actions to solve the overall task. MemoryArena supports evaluation across web navigation, preference-constrained planning, progressive information search, and sequential formal reasoning, and reveals that agents with near-saturated performance on existing long-context memory benchmarks like LoCoMo perform poorly in our agentic setting, exposing a gap in current evaluations for agents with memory.

### MultiCW: A Large-Scale Balanced Benchmark Dataset for Training Robust Check-Worthiness Detection Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how media professionals verify information, yet automated support for detecting check-worthy claims a key step in the fact-checking process remains limited. We introduce the Multi-Check-Worthy (MultiCW) dataset, a balanced multilingual benchmark for check-worthy claim detection spanning 16 languages, 7 topical domains, and 2 writing styles. It consists of 123,722 samples, evenly distributed between noisy (informal) and structured (formal) texts, with balanced representation of check-worthy and non-check-worthy classes across all languages. To probe robustness, we also introduce an equally balanced out-of-distribution evaluation set of 27,761 samples in 4 additional languages. To provide baselines, we benchmark 3 common fine-tuned multilingual transformers against a diverse set of 15 commercial and open LLMs under zero-shot settings. Our findings show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot LLMs on claim classification and show strong out-of-distribution generalization across languages, domains, and styles. MultiCW provides a rigorous multilingual resource for advancing automated fact-checking and enables systematic comparisons between fine-tuned models and cutting-edge LLMs on the check-worthy claim detection task.

### Aladdin-FTI @ AMIYA Three Wishes for Arabic NLP: Fidelity, Diglossia, and Multidialectal Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16290v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16290v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16290v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16290v1)

Arabic dialects have long been under-represented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research due to their non-standardization and high variability, which pose challenges for computational modeling. Recent advances in the field, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising avenues to address this gap by enabling Arabic to be modeled as a pluricentric language rather than a monolithic system. This paper presents Aladdin-FTI, our submission to the AMIYA shared task. The proposed system is designed to both generate and translate dialectal Arabic (DA). Specifically, the model supports text generation in Moroccan, Egyptian, Palestinian, Syrian, and Saudi dialects, as well as bidirectional translation between these dialects, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and English. The code and trained model are publicly available.

### Lyapunov Spectral Analysis of Speech Embedding Trajectories in Psychosis

We analyze speech embeddings from structured clinical interviews of psychotic patients and healthy controls by treating language production as a high-dimensional dynamical process. Lyapunov exponent (LE) spectra are computed from word-level and answer-level embeddings generated by two distinct large language models, allowing us to assess the stability of the conclusions with respect to different embedding presentations. Word-level embeddings exhibit uniformly contracting dynamics with no positive LE, while answer-level embeddings, in spite of the overall contraction, display a number of positive LEs and higher-dimensional attractors. The resulting LE spectra robustly separate psychotic from healthy speech, while differentiation within the psychotic group is not statistically significant overall, despite a tendency of the most severe cases to occupy distinct dynamical regimes. These findings indicate that nonlinear dynamical invariants of speech embeddings provide a physics-inspired probe of disordered cognition whose conclusions remain stable across embedding models.

### Are LLMs Ready to Replace Bangla Annotators?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated annotators to scale dataset creation, yet their reliability as unbiased annotators--especially for low-resource and identity-sensitive settings--remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the behavior of LLMs as zero-shot annotators for Bangla hate speech, a task where even human agreement is challenging, and annotator bias can have serious downstream consequences. We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments. Surprisingly, increased model scale does not guarantee improved annotation quality--smaller, more task-aligned models frequently exhibit more consistent behavior than their larger counterparts. These results highlight important limitations of current LLMs for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages and underscore the need for careful evaluation before deployment.

### Long-Tail Knowledge in Large Language Models: Taxonomy, Mechanisms, Interventions and Implications

Large language models (LLMs) are trained on web-scale corpora that exhibit steep power-law distributions, in which the distribution of knowledge is highly long-tailed, with most appearing infrequently. While scaling has improved average-case performance, persistent failures on low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge remain poorly characterized. This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives.
  We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation. Taken together, this paper provides a unifying conceptual framework for understanding how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, lost, evaluated, and manifested in deployed language model systems.

### The Validity of Coreference-based Evaluations of Natural Language Understanding

In this thesis, I refine our understanding as to what conclusions we can reach from coreference-based evaluations by expanding existing evaluation practices and considering the extent to which evaluation results are either converging or conflicting. First, I analyze standard coreference evaluations and show that their design often leads to non-generalizable conclusions due to issues of measurement validity - including contestedness (multiple, competing definitions of coreference) and convergent validity (evaluation results that rank models differently across benchmarks). Second, I propose and implement a novel evaluation focused on testing systems' ability to infer the relative plausibility of events, a key aspect of resolving coreference. Through this extended evaluation, I find that contemporary language models demonstrate strong performance on standard benchmarks - improving over earlier baseline systems within certain domains and types of coreference - but remain sensitive to the evaluation conditions: they often fail to generalize in ways one would expect a human to be capable of when evaluation contexts are slightly modified. Taken together, these findings clarify both the strengths, such as improved accuracy over baselines on widely used evaluations, and the limitations of the current NLP paradigm, including weaknesses in measurement validity, and suggest directions for future work in developing better evaluation methods and more genuinely generalizable systems.

### One Hand to Rule Them All: Canonical Representations for Unified Dexterous Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16712v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16712v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16712v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16712v1)

Dexterous manipulation policies today largely assume fixed hand designs, severely restricting their generalization to new embodiments with varied kinematic and structural layouts. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a parameterized canonical representation that unifies a broad spectrum of dexterous hand architectures. It comprises a unified parameter space and a canonical URDF format, offering three key advantages. 1) The parameter space captures essential morphological and kinematic variations for effective conditioning in learning algorithms. 2) A structured latent manifold can be learned over our space, where interpolations between embodiments yield smooth and physically meaningful morphology transitions. 3) The canonical URDF standardizes the action space while preserving dynamic and functional properties of the original URDFs, enabling efficient and reliable cross-embodiment policy learning. We validate these advantages through extensive analysis and experiments, including grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment zero-shot transfer. Specifically, we train a VAE on the unified representation to obtain a compact, semantically rich latent embedding, and develop a grasping policy conditioned on the canonical representation that generalizes across dexterous hands. We demonstrate, through simulation and real-world tasks on unseen morphologies (e.g., 81.9% zero-shot success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand), that our framework unifies both the representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands, providing a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation.

### EgoScale: Scaling Dexterous Manipulation with Diverse Egocentric Human Data

Human behavior is among the most scalable sources of data for learning physical intelligence, yet how to effectively leverage it for dexterous manipulation remains unclear. While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior.

### Learning Humanoid End-Effector Control for Open-Vocabulary Visual Loco-Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16705v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16705v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16705v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16705v1)

Visual loco-manipulation of arbitrary objects in the wild with humanoid robots requires accurate end-effector (EE) control and a generalizable understanding of the scene via visual inputs (e.g., RGB-D images). Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects.

### Learning to unfold cloth: Scaling up world models to deformable object manipulation

Learning to manipulate cloth is both a paradigmatic problem for robotic research and a problem of immediate relevance to a variety of applications ranging from assistive care to the service industry. The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.

### Towards Autonomous Robotic Kidney Ultrasound: Spatial-Efficient Volumetric Imaging via Template Guided Optimal Pivoting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16641v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16641v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16641v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16641v1)

Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is a frontline tool for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. However, traditional freehand imaging procedure suffers from inconsistent, operator-dependent outcomes, lack of 3D localization information, and risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. While robotic ultrasound (RUS) systems offer the potential for standardized, operator-independent 3D kidney data acquisition, the existing scanning methods lack the ability to determine the optimal imaging window for efficient imaging. As a result, the scan is often blindly performed with excessive probe footprint, which frequently leads to acoustic shadowing and incomplete organ coverage. Consequently, there is a critical need for a spatially efficient imaging technique that can maximize the kidney coverage through minimum probe footprint. Here, we propose an autonomous workflow to achieve efficient kidney imaging via template-guided optimal pivoting. The system first performs an explorative imaging to generate partial observations of the kidney. This data is then registered to a kidney template to estimate the organ pose. With the kidney localized, the robot executes a fixed-point pivoting sweep where the imaging plane is aligned with the kidney long axis to minimize the probe translation. The proposed method was validated in simulation and in-vivo. Simulation results indicate that a 60% exploration ratio provides optimal balance between kidney localization accuracy and scanning efficiency. In-vivo evaluation on two male subjects demonstrates a kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees. Moreover, the optimal pivoting approach shortened the probe footprint by around 75 mm when compared with the baselines. These results valid our approach of leveraging anatomical templates to align the probe optimally for volumetric sweep.

### Sensor Query Schedule and Sensor Noise Covariances for Accuracy-constrained Trajectory Estimation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16598v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16598v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16598v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16598v1)

Trajectory estimation involves determining the trajectory of a mobile robot by combining prior knowledge about its dynamic model with noisy observations of its state obtained using sensors. The accuracy of such a procedure is dictated by the system model fidelity and the sensor parameters, such as the accuracy of the sensor (as represented by its noise covariance) and the rate at which it can generate observations, referred to as the sensor query schedule. Intuitively, high-rate measurements from accurate sensors lead to accurate trajectory estimation. However, cost and resource constraints limit the sensor accuracy and its measurement rate. Our work's novel contribution is the estimation of sensor schedules and sensor covariances necessary to achieve a specific estimation accuracy. Concretely, we focus on estimating: (i) the rate or schedule with which a sensor of known covariance must generate measurements to achieve specific estimation accuracy, and alternatively, (ii) the sensor covariance necessary to achieve specific estimation accuracy for a given sensor update rate. We formulate the problem of estimating these sensor parameters as semidefinite programs, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. We validate our approach in simulation and real experiments by showing that the sensor schedules and the sensor covariances calculated using our proposed method achieve the desired trajectory estimation accuracy. Our method also identifies scenarios where certain estimation accuracy is unachievable with the given system and sensor characteristics.

### Decentralized and Fully Onboard: Range-Aided Cooperative Localization and Navigation on Micro Aerial Vehicles

Controlling a team of robots in a coordinated manner is challenging because centralized approaches (where all computation is performed on a central machine) scale poorly, and globally referenced external localization systems may not always be available. In this work, we consider the problem of range-aided decentralized localization and formation control. In such a setting, each robot estimates its relative pose by combining data only from onboard odometry sensors and distance measurements to other robots in the team. Additionally, each robot calculates the control inputs necessary to collaboratively navigate an environment to accomplish a specific task, for example, moving in a desired formation while monitoring an area. We present a block coordinate descent approach to localization that does not require strict coordination between the robots. We present a novel formulation for formation control as inference on factor graphs that takes into account the state estimation uncertainty and can be solved efficiently. Our approach to range-aided localization and formation-based navigation is completely decentralized, does not require specialized trajectories to maintain formation, and achieves decimeter-level positioning and formation control accuracy. We demonstrate our approach through multiple real experiments involving formation flights in diverse indoor and outdoor environments.

### VIGOR: Visual Goal-In-Context Inference for Unified Humanoid Fall Safety

Reliable fall recovery is critical for humanoids operating in cluttered environments. Unlike quadrupeds or wheeled robots, humanoids experience high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes during a fall, making recovery essential for continued operation. Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems such as fall avoidance, impact mitigation, and stand-up recovery, or rely on end-to-end policies trained without vision through reinforcement learning or imitation learning, often on flat terrain. At a deeper level, fall safety is treated as monolithic data complexity, coupling pose, dynamics, and terrain and requiring exhaustive coverage, limiting scalability and generalization. We present a unified fall safety approach that spans all phases of fall recovery. It builds on two insights: 1) Natural human fall and recovery poses are highly constrained and transferable from flat to complex terrain through alignment, and 2) Fast whole-body reactions require integrated perceptual-motor representations. We train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, and distill it into a deployable student that relies only on egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns how to react by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation, which combines the next target pose with the local terrain, rather than separately encoding what it must perceive and how it must act. Results in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments without real-world fine-tuning.

### Reactive Motion Generation With Particle-Based Perception in Dynamic Environments

Reactive motion generation in dynamic and unstructured scenarios is typically subject to essentially static perception and system dynamics. Reliably modeling dynamic obstacles and optimizing collision-free trajectories under perceptive and control uncertainty are challenging. This article focuses on revealing tight connection between reactive planning and dynamic mapping for manipulators from a model-based perspective. To enable efficient particle-based perception with expressively dynamic property, we present a tensorized particle weight update scheme that explicitly maintains obstacle velocities and covariance meanwhile. Building upon this dynamic representation, we propose an obstacle-aware MPPI-based planning formulation that jointly propagates robot-obstacle dynamics, allowing future system motion to be predicted and evaluated under uncertainty. The model predictive method is shown to significantly improve safety and reactivity with dynamic surroundings. By applying our complete framework in simulated and noisy real-world environments, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of robot-obstacle dynamics consistently enhances performance over state-of-the-art MPPI-based perception-planning baselines avoiding multiple static and dynamic obstacles.

### RoboGene: Boosting VLA Pre-training via Diversity-Driven Agentic Framework for Real-World Task Generation

The pursuit of general-purpose robotic manipulation is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, real-world interaction data. Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.

### Dynamic Modeling and MPC for Locomotion of Tendon-Driven Soft Quadruped

SLOT (Soft Legged Omnidirectional Tetrapod), a tendon-driven soft quadruped robot with 3D-printed TPU legs, is presented to study physics-informed modeling and control of compliant legged locomotion using only four actuators. Each leg is modeled as a deformable continuum using discrete Cosserat rod theory, enabling the capture of large bending deformations, distributed elasticity, tendon actuation, and ground contact interactions. A modular whole-body modeling framework is introduced, in which compliant leg dynamics are represented through physically consistent reaction forces applied to a rigid torso, providing a scalable interface between continuum soft limbs and rigid-body locomotion dynamics. This formulation allows efficient whole-body simulation and real-time control without sacrificing physical fidelity. The proposed model is embedded into a convex model predictive control framework that optimizes ground reaction forces over a 0.495 s prediction horizon and maps them to tendon actuation through a physics-informed force-angle relationship. The resulting controller achieves asymptotic stability under diverse perturbations. The framework is experimentally validated on a physical prototype during crawling and walking gaits, achieving high accuracy with less than 5 mm RMSE in center of mass trajectories. These results demonstrate a generalizable approach for integrating continuum soft legs into model-based locomotion control, advancing scalable and reusable modeling and control methods for soft quadruped robots.

### Markerless 6D Pose Estimation and Position-Based Visual Servoing for Endoscopic Continuum Manipulators

Continuum manipulators in flexible endoscopic surgical systems offer high dexterity for minimally invasive procedures; however, accurate pose estimation and closed-loop control remain challenging due to hysteresis, compliance, and limited distal sensing. Vision-based approaches reduce hardware complexity but are often constrained by limited geometric observability and high computational overhead, restricting real-time closed-loop applicability. This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing.

### Docking and Persistent Operations for a Resident Underwater Vehicle

Our understanding of the oceans remains limited by sparse and infrequent observations, primarily because current methods are constrained by the high cost and logistical effort of underwater monitoring, relying either on sporadic surveys across broad areas or on long-term measurements at fixed locations. To overcome these limitations, monitoring systems must enable persistent and autonomous operations without the need for continuous surface support. Despite recent advances, resident underwater vehicles remain uncommon due to persistent challenges in autonomy, robotic resilience, and mechanical robustness, particularly under long-term deployment in harsh and remote environments. This work addresses these problems by presenting the development, deployment, and operation of a resident infrastructure using a docking station with a mini-class Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) at 90m depth. The ROVis equipped with enhanced onboard processing and perception, allowing it to autonomously navigate using USBL signals, dock via ArUco marker-based visual localisation fused through an Extended Kalman Filter, and carry out local inspection routines. The system demonstrated a 90% autonomous docking success rate and completed full inspection missions within four minutes, validating the integration of acoustic and visual navigation in real-world conditions. These results show that reliable, untethered operations at depth are feasible, highlighting the potential of resident ROV systems for scalable, cost-effective underwater monitoring.

### System Identification under Constraints and Disturbance: A Bayesian Estimation Approach
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16358v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16358v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16358v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16358v1)

We introduce a Bayesian system identification (SysID) framework for jointly estimating robot's state trajectories and physical parameters with high accuracy. It embeds physically consistent inverse dynamics, contact and loop-closure constraints, and fully featured joint friction models as hard, stage-wise equality constraints. It relies on energy-based regressors to enhance parameter observability, supports both equality and inequality priors on inertial and actuation parameters, enforces dynamically consistent disturbance projections, and augments proprioceptive measurements with energy observations to disambiguate nonlinear friction effects. To ensure scalability, we derive a parameterized equality-constrained Riccati recursion that preserves the banded structure of the problem, achieving linear complexity in the time horizon, and develop computationally efficient derivatives. Simulation studies on representative robotic systems, together with hardware experiments on a Unitree B1 equipped with a Z1 arm, demonstrate faster convergence, lower inertial and friction estimation errors, and improved contact consistency compared to forward-dynamics and decoupled identification baselines. When deployed within model predictive control frameworks, the resulting models yield measurable improvements in tracking performance during locomotion over challenging environments.

### Articulated 3D Scene Graphs for Open-World Mobile Manipulation

Semantics has enabled 3D scene understanding and affordance-driven object interaction. However, robots operating in real-world environments face a critical limitation: they cannot anticipate how objects move. Long-horizon mobile manipulation requires closing the gap between semantics, geometry, and kinematics. In this work, we present MoMa-SG, a novel framework for building semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs of articulated scenes containing a myriad of interactable objects. Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach. In addition, real-world experiments on both a quadruped and a mobile manipulator demonstrate that our semantic-kinematic scene graphs enable robust manipulation of articulated objects in everyday home environments. We provide code and data at: https://momasg.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### Dual-Quadruped Collaborative Transportation in Narrow Environments via Safe Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16353v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16353v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16353v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16353v1)

Collaborative transportation, where multiple robots collaboratively transport a payload, has garnered significant attention in recent years. While ensuring safe and high-performance inter-robot collaboration is critical for effective task execution, it is difficult to pursue in narrow environments where the feasible region is extremely limited. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for dual-quadruped collaborative transportation via safe reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we model the task as a fully cooperative constrained Markov game, where collision avoidance is formulated as constraints. We introduce a cost-advantage decomposition method that enforces the sum of team constraints to remain below an upper bound, thereby guaranteeing task safety within an RL framework. Furthermore, we propose a constraint allocation method that assigns shared constraints to individual robots to maximize the overall task reward, encouraging autonomous task-assignment among robots, thereby improving collaborative task performance. Simulation and real-time experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance and a higher success rate in dual-quadruped collaborative transportation compared to existing methods.

### SCAR: Satellite Imagery-Based Calibration for Aerial Recordings
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16349v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16349v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16349v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.16349v1)

We introduce SCAR, a method for long-term auto-calibration refinement of aerial visual-inertial systems that exploits georeferenced satellite imagery as a persistent global reference. SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention.

Skeletal muscle-based biohybrid actuators have proved to be a promising component in soft robotics, offering efficient movement. However, their intrinsic biological variability and nonlinearity pose significant challenges for controllability and predictability. To address these issues, this study investigates the application of supervised learning, a form of machine learning, to model and predict the behavior of biohybrid machines (BHMs), focusing on a muscle ring anchored on flexible polymer pillars. First, static prediction models (i.e., random forest and neural network regressors) are trained to estimate the maximum exerted force achieved from input variables such as muscle sample, electrical stimulation parameters, and baseline exerted force. Second, a dynamic modeling framework, based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, is developed to serve as a digital twin, replicating the time series of exerted forces observed in response to electrical stimulation. Both modeling approaches demonstrate high predictive accuracy. The best performance of the static models is characterized by R2 of 0.9425, whereas the dynamic model achieves R2 of 0.9956. The static models can enable optimization of muscle actuator performance for targeted applications and required force outcomes, while the dynamic model provides a foundation for developing robustly adaptive control strategies in future biohybrid robotic systems.

The capability of multi-robot SLAM approaches to merge localization history and maps from different observers is often challenged by the difficulty in establishing data association. Loop closure detection between perceptual inputs of different robotic agents is easily compromised in the context of perceptual aliasing, or when perspectives differ significantly. For this reason, direct mutual observation among robots is a powerful way to connect partial SLAM graphs, but often relies on the presence of calibrated arrays of fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTag arrays), which severely limits the range of observations and frequently fails under sharp lighting conditions, e.g., reflections or overexposure. In this work, we propose a novel solution to this problem leveraging recent advances in Deep-Learning-based 6D pose estimation. We feature markerless pose estimation as part of a decentralized multi-robot SLAM system and demonstrate the benefit to the relative localization accuracy among the robotic team. The solution is validated experimentally on data recorded in a test field campaign on a planetary analogous environment.

This paper proposes a nonplanar model predictive control (MPC) framework for autonomous vehicles operating on nonplanar terrain. To approximate complex vehicle dynamics in such environments, we develop a geometry-aware modeling approach that learns a residual Gaussian Process (GP). By utilizing a recursive sparse GP, the framework enables real-time adaptation to varying terrain geometry. The effectiveness of the learned model is demonstrated in a reference-tracking task using a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. Validation within a custom Isaac Sim environment confirms the framework's capability to maintain high tracking accuracy on challenging 3D surfaces.
