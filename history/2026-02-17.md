### EditCtrl: Disentangled Local and Global Control for Real-Time Generative Video Editing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15031v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.15031v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15031v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.15031v1)

High-fidelity generative video editing has seen significant quality improvements by leveraging pre-trained video foundation models. However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.

### Image Generation with a Sphere Encoder
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15030v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.15030v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15030v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.15030v1)

We introduce the Sphere Encoder, an efficient generative framework capable of producing images in a single forward pass and competing with many-step diffusion models using fewer than five steps. Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost.

### Neurosim: A Fast Simulator for Neuromorphic Robot Perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15018v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.15018v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15018v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.15018v1)

Neurosim is a fast, real-time, high-performance library for simulating sensors such as dynamic vision sensors, RGB cameras, depth sensors, and inertial sensors. It can also simulate agile dynamics of multi-rotor vehicles in complex and dynamic environments. Neurosim can achieve frame rates as high as ~2700 FPS on a desktop GPU. Neurosim integrates with a ZeroMQ-based communication library called Cortex to facilitate seamless integration with machine learning and robotics workflows. Cortex provides a high-throughput, low-latency message-passing system for Python and C++ applications, with native support for NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors. This paper discusses the design philosophy behind Neurosim and Cortex. It demonstrates how they can be used to (i) train neuromorphic perception and control algorithms, e.g., using self-supervised learning on time-synchronized multi-modal data, and (ii) test real-time implementations of these algorithms in closed-loop. Neurosim and Cortex are available at https://github.com/grasp-lyrl/neurosim .

### ThermEval: A Structured Benchmark for Evaluation of Vision-Language Models on Thermal Imagery
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14989v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14989v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14989v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14989v1)

Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on RGB imagery, but they do not generalize to thermal images. Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.

### PAct: Part-Decomposed Single-View Articulated Object Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14965v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14965v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14965v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14965v1)

Articulated objects are central to interactive 3D applications, including embodied AI, robotics, and VR/AR, where functional part decomposition and kinematic motion are essential. Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time.

### AnchorWeave: World-Consistent Video Generation with Retrieved Local Spatial Memories
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14941v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14941v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14941v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14941v1)

2026/02/16 17:23 GTM

Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.

### Wrivinder: Towards Spatial Intelligence for Geo-locating Ground Images onto Satellite Imagery
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14929v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14929v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14929v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14929v1)

2026/02/16 17:06 GTM

Aligning ground-level imagery with geo-registered satellite maps is crucial for mapping, navigation, and situational awareness, yet remains challenging under large viewpoint gaps or when GPS is unreliable. We introduce Wrivinder, a zero-shot, geometry-driven framework that aggregates multiple ground photographs to reconstruct a consistent 3D scene and align it with overhead satellite imagery. Wrivinder combines SfM reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting, semantic grounding, and monocular depth--based metric cues to produce a stable zenith-view rendering that can be directly matched to satellite context for metrically accurate camera geo-localization. To support systematic evaluation of this task, which lacks suitable benchmarks, we also release MC-Sat, a curated dataset linking multi-view ground imagery with geo-registered satellite tiles across diverse outdoor environments. Together, Wrivinder and MC-Sat provide a first comprehensive baseline and testbed for studying geometry-centered cross-view alignment without paired supervision. In zero-shot experiments, Wrivinder achieves sub-30\,m geolocation accuracy across both dense and large-area scenes, highlighting the promise of geometry-based aggregation for robust ground-to-satellite localization.

### Picking the Right Specialist: Attentive Neural Process-based Selection of Task-Specialized Models as Tools for Agentic Healthcare Systems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14901v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14901v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14901v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14901v1)

2026/02/16 16:36 GTM

Task-specialized models form the backbone of agentic healthcare systems, enabling the agents to answer clinical queries across tasks such as disease diagnosis, localization, and report generation. Yet, for a given task, a single "best" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.

### Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization using CLIP-Based Semantic Alignment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14889v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14889v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14889v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14889v1)

2026/02/16 16:20 GTM

We introduce Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization, a lightweight framework for generating summaries by combining retrieved text and image data from web sources. Given a user-defined topic, the system performs parallel web, news, and image searches. Retrieved images are ranked using a fine-tuned CLIP model to measure semantic alignment with topic and text. Optional BLIP captioning enables image-only summaries for stronger multimodal coherence.The pipeline supports features such as adjustable fetch limits, semantic filtering, summary styling, and downloading structured outputs. We expose the system via a Gradio-based API with controllable parameters and preconfigured presets.Evaluation on 500 image-caption pairs with 20:1 contrastive negatives yields a ROC-AUC of 0.9270, an F1-score of 0.6504, and an accuracy of 96.99%, demonstrating strong multimodal alignment. This work provides a configurable, deployable tool for web-scale summarization that integrates language, retrieval, and vision models in a user-extensible pipeline.

### CT-Bench: A Benchmark for Multimodal Lesion Understanding in Computed Tomography
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14879v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14879v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14879v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14879v1)

2026/02/16 16:10 GTM

Artificial intelligence (AI) can automatically delineate lesions on computed tomography (CT) and generate radiology report content, yet progress is limited by the scarcity of publicly available CT datasets with lesion-level annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce CT-Bench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset comprising two components: a Lesion Image and Metadata Set containing 20,335 lesions from 7,795 CT studies with bounding boxes, descriptions, and size information, and a multitask visual question answering benchmark with 2,850 QA pairs covering lesion localization, description, size estimation, and attribute categorization. Hard negative examples are included to reflect real-world diagnostic challenges. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art multimodal models, including vision-language and medical CLIP variants, by comparing their performance to radiologist assessments, demonstrating the value of CT-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for lesion analysis. Moreover, fine-tuning models on the Lesion Image and Metadata Set yields significant performance gains across both components, underscoring the clinical utility of CT-Bench.

### Multi-dimensional Persistent Sheaf Laplacians for Image Analysis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14846v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14846v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14846v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14846v1)

2026/02/16 15:44 GTM

We propose a multi-dimensional persistent sheaf Laplacian (MPSL) framework on simplicial complexes for image analysis. The proposed method is motivated by the strong sensitivity of commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to the choice of reduced dimension. Rather than selecting a single reduced dimension or averaging results across dimensions, we exploit complementary advantages of multiple reduced dimensions. At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations. We evaluate the proposed framework on the COIL20 and ETH80 image datasets using standard classification protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more stable performance across a wide range of reduced dimensions and achieves consistent improvements to PCA-based baselines in moderate dimensional regimes.

### Integrating Affordances and Attention models for Short-Term Object Interaction Anticipation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14837v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14837v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14837v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14837v1)

2026/02/16 15:29 GTM

Short Term object-interaction Anticipation consists in detecting the location of the next active objects, the noun and verb categories of the interaction, as well as the time to contact from the observation of egocentric video. This ability is fundamental for wearable assistants to understand user goals and provide timely assistance, or to enable human-robot interaction. In this work, we present a method to improve the performance of STA predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: 1 We propose STAformer and STAformer plus plus, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2 We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot. Our results show significant improvements on Overall Top-5 mAP, with gain up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on a novel set of curated EPIC-Kitchens STA labels. We released the code, annotations, and pre-extracted affordances on Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens to encourage future research in this area.

### Debiasing Central Fixation Confounds Reveals a Peripheral "Sweet Spot" for Human-like Scanpaths in Hard-Attention Vision
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14834v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14834v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14834v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14834v1)

2026/02/16 15:25 GTM

Human eye movements in visual recognition reflect a balance between foveal sampling and peripheral context. Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a "shortcut regime" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias.

### VIPA: Visual Informative Part Attention for Referring Image Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14788v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14788v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14788v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14788v1)

2026/02/16 14:36 GTM

Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment a target object described by a natural language expression. Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.

### GOT-JEPA: Generic Object Tracking with Model Adaptation and Occlusion Handling using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14771v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14771v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14771v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14771v1)

2026/02/16 14:26 GTM

The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.

### SAILS: Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics for Task-Invariant and Training-Free Continual Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14767v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14767v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14767v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14767v1)

2026/02/16 14:14 GTM

Continual learning remains constrained by the need for repeated retraining, high computational costs, and the persistent challenge of forgetting. These factors significantly limit the applicability of continuous learning in real-world settings, as iterative model updates require significant computational resources and inherently exacerbate forgetting. We present SAILS -- Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics, a training-free framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) that sidesteps these challenges entirely. SAILS leverages foundational models to decouple CISS into two stages: Zero-shot region extraction using Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by semantic association through prototypes in a fixed feature space. SAILS incorporates selective intra-class clustering, resulting in multiple prototypes per class to better model intra-class variability. Our results demonstrate that, despite requiring no incremental training, SAILS typically surpasses the performance of existing training-based approaches on standard CISS datasets, particularly in long and challenging task sequences where forgetting tends to be most severe. By avoiding parameter updates, SAILS completely eliminates forgetting and maintains consistent, task-invariant performance. Furthermore, SAILS exhibits positive backward transfer, where the introduction of new classes can enhance performance on previous classes.

### Universal Algorithm-Implicit Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14761v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14761v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14761v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14761v1)

2026/02/16 14:05 GTM

Current meta-learning methods are constrained to narrow task distributions with fixed feature and label spaces, limiting applicability. Moreover, the current meta-learning literature uses key terms like "universal" and "general-purpose" inconsistently and lacks precise definitions, hindering comparability. We introduce a theoretical framework for meta-learning which formally defines practical universality and introduces a distinction between algorithm-explicit and algorithm-implicit learning, providing a principled vocabulary for reasoning about universal meta-learning methods. Guided by this framework, we present TAIL, a transformer-based algorithm-implicit meta-learner that functions across tasks with varying domains, modalities, and label configurations. TAIL features three innovations over prior transformer-based meta-learners: random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings that extrapolate to larger label spaces, and efficient inline query processing. TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard few-shot benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it also generalizes to unseen modalities, solving text classification tasks despite training exclusively on images, handles tasks with up to 20$\times$ more classes than seen during training, and provides orders-of-magnitude computational savings over prior transformer-based approaches.

### Depth Completion as Parameter-Efficient Test-Time Adaptation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14751v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14751v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14751v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14751v1)

2026/02/16 13:53 GTM

We introduce CAPA, a parameter-efficient test-time optimization framework that adapts pre-trained 3D foundation models (FMs) for depth completion, using sparse geometric cues. Unlike prior methods that train task-specific encoders for auxiliary inputs, which often overfit and generalize poorly, CAPA freezes the FM backbone. Instead, it updates only a minimal set of parameters using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (e.g. LoRA or VPT), guided by gradients calculated directly from the sparse observations available at inference time. This approach effectively grounds the foundation model's geometric prior in the scene-specific measurements, correcting distortions and misplaced structures. For videos, CAPA introduces sequence-level parameter sharing, jointly adapting all frames to exploit temporal correlations, improve robustness, and enforce multi-frame consistency. CAPA is model-agnostic, compatible with any ViT-based FM, and achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse condition patterns on both indoor and outdoor datasets.

### It's a Matter of Time: Three Lessons on Long-Term Motion for Perception
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14705v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14705v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14705v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14705v1)

2026/02/16 12:51 GTM

Temporal information has long been considered to be essential for perception. While there is extensive research on the role of image information for perceptual tasks, the role of the temporal dimension remains less well understood: What can we learn about the world from long-term motion information? What properties does long-term motion information have for visual learning? We leverage recent success in point-track estimation, which offers an excellent opportunity to learn temporal representations and experiment on a variety of perceptual tasks. We draw 3 clear lessons: 1) Long-term motion representations contain information to understand actions, but also objects, materials, and spatial information, often even better than images. 2) Long-term motion representations generalize far better than image representations in low-data settings and in zero-shot tasks. 3) The very low dimensionality of motion information makes motion representations a better trade-off between GFLOPs and accuracy than standard video representations, and used together they achieve higher performance than video representations alone. We hope these insights will pave the way for the design of future models that leverage the power of long-term motion information for perception.

### Exposing Diversity Bias in Deep Generative Models: Statistical Origins and Correction of Diversity Error
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14682v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14682v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14682v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14682v1)

Deep generative models have achieved great success in producing high-quality samples, making them a central tool across machine learning applications. Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results.

### Universal Image Immunization against Diffusion-based Image Editing via Semantic Injection

Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled powerful image editing capabilities guided by natural language prompts, unlocking new creative possibilities. However, they introduce significant ethical and legal risks, such as deepfakes and unauthorized use of copyrighted visual content. To address these risks, image immunization has emerged as a promising defense against AI-driven semantic manipulation. Yet, most existing approaches rely on image-specific adversarial perturbations that require individual optimization for each image, thereby limiting scalability and practicality. In this paper, we propose the first universal image immunization framework that generates a single, broadly applicable adversarial perturbation specifically designed for diffusion-based editing pipelines. Inspired by universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) techniques used in targeted attacks, our method generates a UAP that embeds a semantic target into images to be protected. Simultaneously, it suppresses original content to effectively misdirect the model's attention during editing. As a result, our approach effectively blocks malicious editing attempts by overwriting the original semantic content in the image via the UAP. Moreover, our method operates effectively even in data-free settings without requiring access to training data or domain knowledge, further enhancing its practicality and broad applicability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our method, as the first universal immunization approach, significantly outperforms several baselines in the UAP setting. In addition, despite the inherent difficulty of universal perturbations, our method also achieves performance on par with image-specific methods under a more restricted perturbation budget, while also exhibiting strong black-box transferability across different diffusion models.

### MeFEm: Medical Face Embedding model

We present MeFEm, a vision model based on a modified Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) for biometric and medical analysis from facial images. Key modifications include an axial stripe masking strategy to focus learning on semantically relevant regions, a circular loss weighting scheme, and the probabilistic reassignment of the CLS token for high quality linear probing. Trained on a consolidated dataset of curated images, MeFEm outperforms strong baselines like FaRL and Franca on core anthropometric tasks despite using significantly less data. It also shows promising results on Body Mass Index (BMI) estimation, evaluated on a novel, consolidated closed-source dataset that addresses the domain bias prevalent in existing data. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/boretsyury/MeFEm , offering a strong baseline for future work in this domain.

Global solvers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D vision, offering certifiable solutions to nonconvex geometric optimization problems traditionally addressed by local or heuristic methods. This survey presents the first systematic review of global solvers in geometric vision, unifying the field through a comprehensive taxonomy of three core paradigms: Branch-and-Bound (BnB), Convex Relaxation (CR), and Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). We present their theoretical foundations, algorithmic designs, and practical enhancements for robustness and scalability, examining how each addresses the fundamental nonconvexity of geometric estimation problems. Our analysis spans ten core vision tasks, from Wahba problem to bundle adjustment, revealing the optimality-robustness-scalability trade-offs that govern solver selection. We identify critical future directions: scaling algorithms while maintaining guarantees, integrating data-driven priors with certifiable optimization, establishing standardized benchmarks, and addressing societal implications for safety-critical deployment. By consolidating theoretical foundations, practical advances, and broader impacts, this survey provides a unified perspective and roadmap toward certifiable, trustworthy perception for real-world applications.

Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in generative AI, with natural language emerging as the most common conditioning input. As underlying models grow more powerful, researchers are exploring increasingly diverse conditioning signals, such as depth maps, edge maps, camera parameters, and reference images, to give users finer control over generation. Among different modalities, sketches are a natural and long-standing form of human communication, enabling rapid expression of visual concepts. Previous literature has largely focused on edge maps, often misnamed 'sketches', yet algorithms that effectively handle true freehand sketches, with their inherent abstraction and distortions, remain underexplored. We pursue the challenging goal of balancing photorealism with sketch adherence when generating images from freehand input. A key obstacle is the absence of ground-truth, pixel-aligned images: by their nature, freehand sketches do not have a single correct alignment. To address this, we propose a modulation-based approach that prioritizes semantic interpretation of the sketch over strict adherence to individual edge positions. We further introduce a novel loss that enables training on freehand sketches without requiring ground-truth pixel-aligned images. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches in both semantic alignment with freehand sketch inputs and in the realism and overall quality of the generated images.

### VIGIL: Tackling Hallucination Detection in Image Recontextualization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14633v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14633v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14633v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14633v1)

We introduce VIGIL (Visual Inconsistency & Generative In-context Lucidity), the first benchmark dataset and framework providing a fine-grained categorization of hallucinations in the multimodal image recontextualization task for large multimodal models (LMMs). While existing research often treats hallucinations as a uniform issue, our work addresses a significant gap in multimodal evaluation by decomposing these errors into five categories: pasted object hallucinations, background hallucinations, object omission, positional & logical inconsistencies, and physical law violations. To address these complexities, we propose a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our architecture processes recontextualized images through a series of specialized steps targeting object-level fidelity, background consistency, and omission detection, leveraging a coordinated ensemble of open-source models, whose effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations. Our approach enables a deeper understanding of where the models fail with an explanation; thus, we fill a gap in the field, as no prior methods offer such categorization and decomposition for this task. To promote transparency and further exploration, we openly release VIGIL, along with the detection pipeline and benchmark code, through our GitHub repository: https://github.com/mlubneuskaya/vigil and Data repository: https://huggingface.co/datasets/joannaww/VIGIL.

### VariViT: A Vision Transformer for Variable Image Sizes
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14615v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14615v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14615v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14615v1)

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture in representation learning, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to excel in various tasks. ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

You Only Look Once (YOLO) has been the prominent model for computer vision in deep learning for a decade. This study explores the novel aspects of YOLO26, the most recent version in the YOLO series. The elimination of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), implementation of End-to-End NMS-Free Inference, introduction of ProgLoss + Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and use of the MuSGD optimizer are the primary enhancements designed to improve inference speed, which is claimed to achieve a 43% boost in CPU mode. This is designed to allow YOLO26 to attain real-time performance on edge devices or those without GPUs. Additionally, YOLO26 offers improvements in many computer vision tasks, including instance segmentation, pose estimation, and oriented bounding box (OBB) decoding. We aim for this effort to provide more value than just consolidating information already included in the existing technical documentation. Therefore, we performed a rigorous architectural investigation into YOLO26, mostly using the source code available in its GitHub repository and its official documentation. The authentic and detailed operational mechanisms of YOLO26 are inside the source code, which is seldom extracted by others. The YOLO26 architectural diagram is shown as the outcome of the investigation. This study is, to our knowledge, the first one presenting the CNN-based YOLO26 architecture, which is the core of YOLO26. Our objective is to provide a precise architectural comprehension of YOLO26 for researchers and developers aspiring to enhance the YOLO model, ensuring it remains the leading deep learning model in computer vision.

### DriveFine: Refining-Augmented Masked Diffusion VLA for Precise and Robust Driving
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14577v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14577v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14577v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14577v1)

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving increasingly adopt generative planners trained with imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine.

### OmniVTON++: Training-Free Universal Virtual Try-On with Principal Pose Guidance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14552v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14552v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14552v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14552v1)

Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) concerns the synthesis of realistic person imagery through garment re-rendering under human pose and body constraints. In practice, however, existing approaches are typically optimized for specific data conditions, making their deployment reliant on retraining and limiting their generalization as a unified solution. We present OmniVTON++, a training-free VTON framework designed for universal applicability. It addresses the intertwined challenges of garment alignment, human structural coherence, and boundary continuity by coordinating Structured Garment Morphing for correspondence-driven garment adaptation, Principal Pose Guidance for step-wise structural regulation during diffusion sampling, and Continuous Boundary Stitching for boundary-aware refinement, forming a cohesive pipeline without task-specific retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse generalization settings, including cross-dataset and cross-garment-type evaluations, while reliably operating across scenarios and diffusion backbones within a single formulation. In addition to single-garment, single-human cases, the framework supports multi-garment, multi-human, and anime character virtual try-on, expanding the scope of virtual try-on applications. The source code will be released to the public.

### MoRL: Reinforced Reasoning for Unified Motion Understanding and Generation

Human motion understanding and generation are crucial for vision and robotics but remain limited in reasoning capability and test-time planning. We propose MoRL, a unified multimodal motion model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our task-specific reward design combines semantic alignment and reasoning coherence for understanding with physical plausibility and text-motion consistency for generation, improving both logical reasoning and perceptual realism. To further enhance inference, we introduce Chain-of-Motion (CoM), a test-time reasoning method that enables step-by-step planning and reflection. We also construct two large-scale CoT datasets, MoUnd-CoT-140K and MoGen-CoT-140K, to align motion sequences with reasoning traces and action descriptions. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that MoRL achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MoRL.

### Cross-view Domain Generalization via Geometric Consistency for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14525v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14525v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14525v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14525v1)

Domain-generalized LiDAR semantic segmentation (LSS) seeks to train models on source-domain point clouds that generalize reliably to multiple unseen target domains, which is essential for real-world LiDAR applications. However, existing approaches assume similar acquisition views (e.g., vehicle-mounted) and struggle in cross-view scenarios, where observations differ substantially due to viewpoint-dependent structural incompleteness and non-uniform point density. Accordingly, we formulate cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation and propose a novel framework, termed CVGC (Cross-View Geometric Consistency). Specifically, we introduce a cross-view geometric augmentation module that models viewpoint-induced variations in visibility and sampling density, generating multiple cross-view observations of the same scene. Subsequently, a geometric consistency module enforces consistent semantic and occupancy predictions across geometrically augmented point clouds of the same scene. Extensive experiments on six public LiDAR datasets establish the first systematic evaluation of cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation, demonstrating that CVGC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods when generalizing from a single source domain to multiple target domains with heterogeneous acquisition viewpoints. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/KintomZi/CVGC-DG

### Error Patterns in Historical OCR: A Comparative Analysis of TrOCR and a Vision-Language Model

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of eighteenth-century printed texts remains challenging due to degraded print quality, archaic glyphs, and non-standardized orthography. Although transformer-based OCR systems and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong aggregate accuracy, metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) provide limited insight into their reliability for scholarly use. We compare a dedicated OCR transformer (TrOCR) and a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (Qwen) on line-level historical English texts using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis driven error analysis.
  While Qwen achieves lower CER/WER and greater robustness to degraded input, it exhibits selective linguistic regularization and orthographic normalization that may silently alter historically meaningful forms. TrOCR preserves orthographic fidelity more consistently but is more prone to cascading error propagation. Our findings show that architectural inductive biases shape OCR error structure in systematic ways. Models with similar aggregate accuracy can differ substantially in error locality, detectability, and downstream scholarly risk, underscoring the need for architecture-aware evaluation in historical digitization workflows.

### Architectural Insights for Post-Tornado Damage Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14523v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14523v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14523v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14523v1)

Rapid and accurate building damage assessment in the immediate aftermath of tornadoes is critical for coordinating life-saving search and rescue operations, optimizing emergency resource allocation, and accelerating community recovery. However, current automated methods struggle with the unique visual complexity of tornado-induced wreckage, primarily due to severe domain shift from standard pre-training datasets and extreme class imbalance in real-world disaster data. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic experimental framework evaluating 79 open-source deep learning models, encompassing both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers, across over 2,300 controlled experiments on our newly curated Quad-State Tornado Damage (QSTD) benchmark dataset. Our findings reveal that achieving operational-grade performance hinges on a complex interaction between architecture and optimization, rather than architectural selection alone. Most strikingly, we demonstrate that optimizer choice can be more consequential than architecture: switching from Adam to SGD provided dramatic F1 gains of +25 to +38 points for Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer families, fundamentally reversing their ranking from bottom-tier to competitive with top-performing CNNs. Furthermore, a low learning rate of 1x10^(-4) proved universally critical, boosting average F1 performance by +10.2 points across all architectures. Our champion model, ConvNeXt-Base trained with these optimized settings, demonstrated strong cross-event generalization on the held-out Tuscaloosa-Moore Tornado Damage (TMTD) dataset, achieving 46.4% Macro F1 (+34.6 points over baseline) and retaining 85.5% Ordinal Top-1 Accuracy despite temporal and sensor domain shifts.

### Efficient Text-Guided Convolutional Adapter for the Diffusion Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14514v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14514v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14514v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14514v1)

2026/02/16 06:51 GTM

We introduce the Nexus Adapters, novel text-guided efficient adapters to the diffusion-based framework for the Structure Preserving Conditional Generation (SPCG). Recently, structure-preserving methods have achieved promising results in conditional image generation by using a base model for prompt conditioning and an adapter for structure input, such as sketches or depth maps. These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter. Furthermore, we also introduced a lightweight Nexus Slim adapter with 18M fewer parameters than the T2I-Adapter, which still achieved state-of-the-art results.

### MedVAR: Towards Scalable and Efficient Medical Image Generation via Next-scale Autoregressive Prediction

Medical image generation is pivotal in applications like data augmentation for low-resource clinical tasks and privacy-preserving data sharing. However, developing a scalable generative backbone for medical imaging requires architectural efficiency, sufficient multi-organ data, and principled evaluation, yet current approaches leave these aspects unresolved. Therefore, we introduce MedVAR, the first autoregressive-based foundation model that adopts the next-scale prediction paradigm to enable fast and scale-up-friendly medical image synthesis. MedVAR generates images in a coarse-to-fine manner and produces structured multi-scale representations suitable for downstream use. To support hierarchical generation, we curate a harmonized dataset of around 440,000 CT and MRI images spanning six anatomical regions. Comprehensive experiments across fidelity, diversity, and scalability show that MedVAR achieves state-of-the-art generative performance and offers a promising architectural direction for future medical generative foundation models.

### MacNet: An End-to-End Manifold-Constrained Adaptive Clustering Network for Interpretable Whole Slide Image Classification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14509v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14509v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14509v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14509v1)

2026/02/16 06:43 GTM

Whole slide images (WSIs) are the gold standard for pathological diagnosis and sub-typing. Current main-stream two-step frameworks employ offline feature encoders trained without domain-specific knowledge. Among them, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods are outcome-oriented and offer limited interpretability. Clustering-based approaches can provide explainable decision-making process but suffer from high dimension features and semantically ambiguous centroids. To this end, we propose an end-to-end MIL framework that integrates Grassmann re-embedding and manifold adaptive clustering, where the manifold geometric structure facilitates robust clustering results. Furthermore, we design a prior knowledge guiding proxy instance labeling and aggregation strategy to approximate patch labels and focus on pathologically relevant tumor regions. Experiments on multicentre WSI datasets demonstrate that: 1) our cluster-incorporated model achieves superior performance in both grading accuracy and interpretability; 2) end-to-end learning refines better feature representations and it requires acceptable computation resources.

### Prototype Instance-semantic Disentanglement with Low-rank Regularized Subspace Clustering for WSIs Explainable Recognition

The tumor region plays a key role in pathological diagnosis. Tumor tissues are highly similar to precancerous lesions and non tumor instances often greatly exceed tumor instances in whole slide images (WSIs). These issues cause instance-semantic entanglement in multi-instance learning frameworks, degrading both model representation capability and interpretability. To address this, we propose an end-to-end prototype instance semantic disentanglement framework with low-rank regularized subspace clustering, PID-LRSC, in two aspects. First, we use secondary instance subspace learning to construct low-rank regularized subspace clustering (LRSC), addressing instance entanglement caused by an excessive proportion of non tumor instances. Second, we employ enhanced contrastive learning to design prototype instance semantic disentanglement (PID), resolving semantic entanglement caused by the high similarity between tumor and precancerous tissues. We conduct extensive experiments on multicentre pathology datasets, implying that PID-LRSC outperforms other SOTA methods. Overall, PID-LRSC provides clearer instance semantics during decision-making and significantly enhances the reliability of auxiliary diagnostic outcomes.

### Uncertainty-Aware Vision-Language Segmentation for Medical Imaging

2026/02/16 06:27 GTM

We introduce a novel uncertainty-aware multimodal segmentation framework that leverages both radiological images and associated clinical text for precise medical diagnosis. We propose a Modality Decoding Attention Block (MoDAB) with a lightweight State Space Mixer (SSMix) to enable efficient cross-modal fusion and long-range dependency modelling. To guide learning under ambiguity, we propose the Spectral-Entropic Uncertainty (SEU) Loss, which jointly captures spatial overlap, spectral consistency, and predictive uncertainty in a unified objective. In complex clinical circumstances with poor image quality, this formulation improves model reliability. Extensive experiments on various publicly available medical datasets, QATA-COVID19, MosMed++, and Kvasir-SEG, demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance while being significantly more computationally efficient than existing State-of-the-Art (SoTA) approaches. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty modelling and structured modality alignment in vision-language medical segmentation tasks.

### Gaussian Mesh Renderer for Lightweight Differentiable Rendering

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled high-fidelity virtualization with fast rendering and optimization for novel view synthesis. On the other hand, triangle mesh models still remain a popular choice for surface reconstruction but suffer from slow or heavy optimization in traditional mesh-based differentiable renderers. To address this problem, we propose a new lightweight differentiable mesh renderer leveraging the efficient rasterization process of 3DGS, named Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR), which tightly integrates the Gaussian and mesh representations. Each Gaussian primitive is analytically derived from the corresponding mesh triangle, preserving structural fidelity and enabling the gradient flow. Compared to the traditional mesh renderers, our method achieves smoother gradients, which especially contributes to better optimization using smaller batch sizes with limited memory. Our implementation is available in the public GitHub repository at https://github.com/huntorochi/Gaussian-Mesh-Renderer.

### Revisiting the Platonic Representation Hypothesis: An Aristotelian View
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14486v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14486v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14486v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14486v1)

2026/02/16 06:01 GTM

The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that representations from neural networks are converging to a common statistical model of reality. We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships.

### Symmetry in language statistics shapes the geometry of model representations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15029v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.15029v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15029v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.15029v1)

Although learned representations underlie neural networks' success, their fundamental properties remain poorly understood. A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models.

### Scaling Beyond Masked Diffusion Language Models

Diffusion language models are a promising alternative to autoregressive models due to their potential for faster generation. Among discrete diffusion approaches, Masked diffusion currently dominates, largely driven by strong perplexity on language modeling benchmarks. In this work, we present the first scaling law study of uniform-state and interpolating discrete diffusion methods. We also show that Masked diffusion models can be made approximately 12% more FLOPs-efficient when trained with a simple cross-entropy objective. We find that perplexity is informative within a diffusion family but can be misleading across families, where models with worse likelihood scaling may be preferable due to faster and more practical sampling, as reflected by the speed-quality Pareto frontier. These results challenge the view that Masked diffusion is categorically the future of diffusion language modeling and that perplexity alone suffices for cross-algorithm comparison. Scaling all methods to 1.7B parameters, we show that uniform-state diffusion remains competitive on likelihood-based benchmarks and outperforms autoregressive and Masked diffusion models on GSM8K, despite worse validation perplexity.

### Text Style Transfer with Parameter-efficient LLM Finetuning and Round-trip Translation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15013v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.15013v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15013v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.15013v1)

This paper proposes a novel method for Text Style Transfer (TST) based on parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Addressing the scarcity of parallel corpora that map between styles, the study employs roundtrip translation to synthesize such parallel datasets from monolingual corpora. This approach creates 'neutralized' text devoid of stylistic attributes, essentially creating a shared input style at training-time and inference-time. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority of this method over zero-shot prompting and fewshot ICL techniques measured by BLEU scores and style accuracy scores across four investigated domains. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for terminology and name knowledge enhances robustness and stylistic consistency.

### Cold-Start Personalization via Training-Free Priors from Structured World Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15012v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.15012v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15012v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.15012v1)

Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.

### Learning User Interests via Reasoning and Distillation for Cross-Domain News Recommendation

News recommendation plays a critical role in online news platforms by helping users discover relevant content. Cross-domain news recommendation further requires inferring user's underlying information needs from heterogeneous signals that often extend beyond direct news consumption. A key challenge lies in moving beyond surface-level behaviors to capture deeper, reusable user interests while maintaining scalability in large-scale production systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to generate high-quality lists of interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain user signals. We formulate query-list generation as a policy optimization problem and employ GRPO with multiple reward signals. We systematically study two compute dimensions: inference-time sampling and model capacity, and empirically observe consistent improvements with increased compute that exhibit scaling-like behavior. Finally, we perform on-policy distillation to transfer the learned policy from a large, compute-intensive teacher to a compact student model suitable for scalable deployment. Extensive offline experiments, ablation studies and large-scale online A/B tests in a production news recommendation system demonstrate consistent gains in both interest modeling quality and downstream recommendation performance.

### Counterfactual Fairness Evaluation of LLM-Based Contact Center Agent Quality Assurance System
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14970v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14970v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14970v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14970v1)

2026/02/16 17:56 GTM

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in contact-center Quality Assurance (QA) to automate agent performance evaluation and coaching feedback. While LLMs offer unprecedented scalability and speed, their reliance on web-scale training data raises concerns regarding demographic and behavioral biases that may distort workforce assessment. We present a counterfactual fairness evaluation of LLM-based QA systems across 13 dimensions spanning three categories: Identity, Context, and Behavioral Style. Fairness is quantified using the Counterfactual Flip Rate (CFR), the frequency of binary judgment reversals, and the Mean Absolute Score Difference (MASD), the average shift in coaching or confidence scores across counterfactual pairs. Evaluating 18 LLMs on 3,000 real-world contact center transcripts, we find systematic disparities, with CFR ranging from 5.4% to 13.0% and consistent MASD shifts across confidence, positive, and improvement scores. Larger, more strongly aligned models show lower unfairness, though fairness does not track accuracy. Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency. Our findings underscore the need for standardized fairness auditing pipelines prior to deploying LLMs in high-stakes workforce evaluation.

### Tool-Aware Planning in Contact Center AI: Evaluating LLMs through Lineage-Guided Query Decomposition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14955v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14955v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14955v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14955v1)

2026/02/16 17:36 GTM

We present a domain-grounded framework and benchmark for tool-aware plan generation in contact centers, where answering a query for business insights, our target use case, requires decomposing it into executable steps over structured tools (Text2SQL (T2S)/Snowflake) and unstructured tools (RAG/transcripts) with explicit depends_on for parallelism. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reference-based plan evaluation framework operating in two modes - a metric-wise evaluator spanning seven dimensions (e.g., tool-prompt alignment, query adherence) and a one-shot evaluator; (ii) a data curation methodology that iteratively refines plans via an evaluator->optimizer loop to produce high-quality plan lineages (ordered plan revisions) while reducing manual effort; and (iii) a large-scale study of 14 LLMs across sizes and families for their ability to decompose queries into step-by-step, executable, and tool-assigned plans, evaluated under prompts with and without lineage. Empirically, LLMs struggle on compound queries and on plans exceeding 4 steps (typically 5-15); the best total metric score reaches 84.8% (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), while the strongest one-shot match rate at the "A+" tier (Extremely Good, Very Good) is only 49.75% (o3-mini). Plan lineage yields mixed gains overall but benefits several top models and improves step executability for many. Our results highlight persistent gaps in tool-understanding, especially in tool-prompt alignment and tool-usage completeness, and show that shorter, simpler plans are markedly easier. The framework and findings provide a reproducible path for assessing and improving agentic planning with tools for answering data-analysis queries in contact-center settings.

### BFS-PO: Best-First Search for Large Reasoning Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14917v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14917v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14917v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14917v1)

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown excellent performance in reasoning tasks using long reasoning chains. However, this has also led to a significant increase of computational costs and the generation of verbose output, a phenomenon known as overthinking. The tendency to overthinking is often exacerbated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms such as GRPO/DAPO. In this paper, we propose BFS-PO, an RL algorithm which alleviates this problem using a Best-First Search exploration strategy. Specifically, BFS-PO looks for the shortest correct answer using a backtracking mechanism based on maximum entropy nodes. By generating progressively shorter responses during training, BFS-PO learns to produce concise reasoning chains. Using different benchmarks and base LRMs, we show that BFS-PO can simultaneously increase the LRM accuracy and shorten its answers.

### Testimole-Conversational: A 30-Billion-Word Italian Discussion Board Corpus (1996-2024) for Language Modeling and Sociolinguistic Research
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14819v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14819v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14819v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14819v1)

2026/02/16 15:12 GTM

We present "Testimole-conversational" a massive collection of discussion boards messages in the Italian language. The large size of the corpus, more than 30B word-tokens (1996-2024), renders it an ideal dataset for native Italian Large Language Models'pre-training. Furthermore, discussion boards' messages are a relevant resource for linguistic as well as sociological analysis. The corpus captures a rich variety of computer-mediated communication, offering insights into informal written Italian, discourse dynamics, and online social interaction in wide time span. Beyond its relevance for NLP applications such as language modelling, domain adaptation, and conversational analysis, it also support investigations of language variation and social phenomena in digital communication. The resource will be made freely available to the research community.

### Learning State-Tracking from Code Using Linear RNNs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14814v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14814v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14814v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14814v1)

Over the last years, state-tracking tasks, particularly permutation composition, have become a testbed to understand the limits of sequence models architectures like Transformers and RNNs (linear and non-linear). However, these are often sequence-to-sequence tasks: learning to map actions (permutations) to states, which is incompatible with the next-token prediction setting commonly used to train language models. We address this gap by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces that interleave state-reveals through prints and variable transformations. We show that linear RNNs capable of state-tracking excel also in this setting, while Transformers still fail. Motivated by this representation, we investigate why tracking states in code is generally difficult: actions are not always fully observable. We frame this as tracking the state of a probabilistic finite-state automaton with deterministic state reveals and show that linear RNNs can be worse than non-linear RNNs at tracking states in this setup.

### Physical Commonsense Reasoning for Lower-Resourced Languages and Dialects: a Study on Basque
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14812v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14812v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14812v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14812v1)

Physical commonsense reasoning represents a fundamental capability of human intelligence, enabling individuals to understand their environment, predict future events, and navigate physical spaces. Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants.

### Overthinking Loops in Agents: A Structural Risk via MCP Tools
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14798v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14798v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14798v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14798v1)

Tool-using LLM agents increasingly coordinate real workloads by selecting and chaining third-party tools based on text-visible metadata such as tool names, descriptions, and return messages. We show that this convenience creates a supply-chain attack surface: a malicious MCP tool server can be co-registered alongside normal tools and induce overthinking loops, where individually trivial or plausible tool calls compose into cyclic trajectories that inflate end-to-end tokens and latency without any single step looking abnormal. We formalize this as a structural overthinking attack, distinguishable from token-level verbosity, and implement 14 malicious tools across three servers that trigger repetition, forced refinement, and distraction. Across heterogeneous registries and multiple tool-capable models, the attack causes severe resource amplification (up to $142.4\times$ tokens) and can degrade task outcomes. Finally, we find that decoding-time concision controls do not reliably prevent loop induction, suggesting defenses should reason about tool-call structure rather than tokens alone.

### A Geometric Analysis of Small-sized Language Model Hallucinations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14778v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14778v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14778v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14778v1)

2026/02/16 14:29 GTM

Hallucinations -- fluent but factually incorrect responses -- pose a major challenge to the reliability of language models, especially in multi-step or agentic settings.
  This work investigates hallucinations in small-sized LLMs through a geometric perspective, starting from the hypothesis that when models generate multiple responses to the same prompt, genuine ones exhibit tighter clustering in the embedding space, we prove this hypothesis and, leveraging this geometrical insight, we also show that it is possible to achieve a consistent level of separability. This latter result is used to introduce a label-efficient propagation method that classifies large collections of responses from just 30-50 annotations, achieving F1 scores above 90%.
  Our findings, framing hallucinations from a geometric perspective in the embedding space, complement traditional knowledge-centric and single-response evaluation paradigms, paving the way for further research.

### Emergently Misaligned Language Models Show Behavioral Self-Awareness That Shifts With Subsequent Realignment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14777v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14777v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14777v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14777v1)

2026/02/16 14:29 GTM

Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on incorrect trivia question-answer pairs exhibit toxicity - a phenomenon later termed "emergent misalignment". Moreover, research has shown that LLMs possess behavioral self-awareness - the ability to describe learned behaviors that were only implicitly demonstrated in training data. Here, we investigate the intersection of these phenomena. We fine-tune GPT-4.1 models sequentially on datasets known to induce and reverse emergent misalignment and evaluate whether the models are self-aware of their behavior transitions without providing in-context examples. Our results show that emergently misaligned models rate themselves as significantly more harmful compared to their base model and realigned counterparts, demonstrating behavioral self-awareness of their own emergent misalignment. Our findings show that behavioral self-awareness tracks actual alignment states of models, indicating that models can be queried for informative signals about their own safety.

### Multi-Agent Comedy Club: Investigating Community Discussion Effects on LLM Humor Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14770v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14770v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14770v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14770v1)

2026/02/16 14:25 GTM

Prior work has explored multi-turn interaction and feedback for LLM writing, but evaluations still largely center on prompts and localized feedback, leaving persistent public reception in online communities underexamined. We test whether broadcast community discussion improves stand-up comedy writing in a controlled multi-agent sandbox: in the discussion condition, critic and audience threads are recorded, filtered, stored as social memory, and later retrieved to condition subsequent generations, whereas the baseline omits discussion. Across 50 rounds (250 paired monologues) judged by five expert annotators using A/B preference and a 15-item rubric, discussion wins 75.6% of instances and improves Craft/Clarity (Δ = 0.440) and Social Response (Δ = 0.422), with occasional increases in aggressive humor.

### Unlocking Reasoning Capability on Machine Translation in Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14763v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14763v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14763v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14763v1)

Reasoning-oriented large language models (RLMs) achieve strong gains on tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating explicit intermediate reasoning. However, their impact on machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate several open- and closed-weights RLMs on the WMT24++ benchmark and find that enabling explicit reasoning consistently degrades translation quality across languages and models. Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision. We curate a synthetic dataset of dynamic structured reasoning traces and post-train a large reasoning model on this data. Experiments show significant improvements over standard translation fine-tuning and injected generic reasoning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning must be task-structured to benefit MT.

### Residual Connections and the Causal Shift: Uncovering a Structural Misalignment in Transformers
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14760v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14760v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14760v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14760v1)

2026/02/16 14:04 GTM

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with next-token prediction, implemented in autoregressive Transformers via causal masking for parallelism. This creates a subtle misalignment: residual connections tie activations to the current token, while supervision targets the next token, potentially propagating mismatched information if the current token is not the most informative for prediction. In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that these strategies alleviate the representation misalignment and yield improvements, providing an efficient and general architectural enhancement for autoregressive Transformers.

### Cognitive networks reconstruct mindsets about STEM subjects and educational contexts in almost 1000 high-schoolers, University students and LLM-based digital twins
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14749v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14749v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14749v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14749v1)

2026/02/16 13:49 GTM

Attitudes toward STEM develop from the interaction of conceptual knowledge, educational experiences, and affect. Here we use cognitive network science to reconstruct group mindsets as behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs). In this case, nodes are cue words and free associations, edges are empirical associative links, and each concept is annotated with perceived valence. We analyse BFMNs from N = 994 observations spanning high school students, university students, and early-career STEM experts, alongside LLM (GPT-oss) "digital twins" prompted to emulate comparable profiles. Focusing also on semantic neighbourhoods ("frames") around key target concepts (e.g., STEM subjects or educational actors/places), we quantify frames in terms of valence auras, emotional profiles, network overlap (Jaccard similarity), and concreteness relative to null baselines. Across student groups, science and research are consistently framed positively, while their core quantitative subjects (mathematics and statistics) exhibit more negative and anxiety related auras, amplified in higher math-anxiety subgroups, evidencing a STEM-science cognitive and emotional dissonance. High-anxiety frames are also less concrete than chance, suggesting more abstract and decontextualised representations of threatening quantitative domains. Human networks show greater overlapping between mathematics and anxiety than GPT-oss. The results highlight how BFMNs capture cognitive-affective signatures of mindsets towards the target domains and indicate that LLM-based digital twins approximate cultural attitudes but miss key context-sensitive, experience-based components relevant to replicate human educational anxiety.

### Rethinking the Role of LLMs in Time Series Forecasting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14744v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14744v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14744v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14744v1)

2026/02/16 13:39 GTM

Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced to time series forecasting (TSF) to incorporate contextual knowledge beyond numerical signals. However, existing studies question whether LLMs provide genuine benefits, often reporting comparable performance without LLMs. We show that such conclusions stem from limited evaluation settings and do not hold at scale. We conduct a large-scale study of LLM-based TSF (LLM4TSF) across 8 billion observations, 17 forecasting scenarios, 4 horizons, multiple alignment strategies, and both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our results demonstrate that \emph{LLM4TS indeed improves forecasting performance}, with especially large gains in cross-domain generalization. Pre-alignment outperforming post-alignment in over 90\% of tasks. Both pretrained knowledge and model architecture of LLMs contribute and play complementary roles: pretraining is critical under distribution shifts, while architecture excels at modeling complex temporal dynamics. Moreover, under large-scale mixed distributions, a fully intact LLM becomes indispensable, as confirmed by token-level routing analysis and prompt-based improvements. Overall, Our findings overturn prior negative assessments, establish clear conditions under which LLMs are not only useful, and provide practical guidance for effective model design. We release our code at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLM4TSF.

### LLMStructBench: Benchmarking Large Language Model Structured Data Extraction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14743v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14743v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14743v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14743v1)

2026/02/16 13:37 GTM

We present LLMStructBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on extracting structured data and generating valid JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) outputs from natural-language text. Our open dataset comprises diverse, manually verified parsing scenarios of varying complexity and enables systematic testing across 22 models and five prompting strategies. We further introduce complementary performance metrics that capture both token-level accuracy and document-level validity, facilitating rigorous comparison of model, size, and prompting effects on parsing reliability.
  In particular, we show that choosing the right prompting strategy is more important than standard attributes such as model size. This especially ensures structural validity for smaller or less reliable models but increase the number of semantic errors. Our benchmark suite is an step towards future research in the area of LLM applied to parsing or Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) applications.

### Exposing the Systematic Vulnerability of Open-Weight Models to Prefill Attacks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14689v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14689v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14689v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14689v1)

2026/02/16 12:24 GTM

As the capabilities of large language models continue to advance, so does their potential for misuse. While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs.

### Crowdsourcing Piedmontese to Test LLMs on Non-Standard Orthography
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14675v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14675v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14675v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14675v1)

2026/02/16 12:02 GTM

We present a crowdsourced dataset for Piedmontese, an endangered Romance language of northwestern Italy. The dataset comprises 145 Italian-Piedmontese parallel sentences derived from Flores+, with translations produced by speakers writing in their natural orthographic style rather than adhering to standardized conventions, along with manual word alignment. We use this resource to benchmark several large language models on tokenization parity, topic classification, and machine translation. Our analysis reveals that Piedmontese incurs a tokenization penalty relative to higher-resource Romance languages, yet LLMs achieve classification performance approaching that of Italian, French, and English. Machine translation results are asymmetric: models translate adequately from Piedmontese into high-resource languages, but generation into Piedmontese remains challenging. The dataset and code are publicly released.

### Breaking Data Efficiency Dilemma: A Federated and Augmented Learning Framework For Alzheimer's Disease Detection via Speech
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14655v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14655v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14655v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14655v1)

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is crucial for delaying its progression. While AI-based speech detection is non-invasive and cost-effective, it faces a critical data efficiency dilemma due to medical data scarcity and privacy barriers. Therefore, we propose FAL-AD, a novel framework that synergistically integrates federated learning with data augmentation to systematically optimize data efficiency. Our approach delivers three key breakthroughs: First, absolute efficiency improvement through voice conversion-based augmentation, which generates diverse pathological speech samples via cross-category voice-content recombination. Second, collaborative efficiency breakthrough via an adaptive federated learning paradigm, maximizing cross-institutional benefits under privacy constraints.

### Is Information Density Uniform when Utterances are Grounded on Perception and Discourse?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14653v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14653v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14653v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14653v1)

The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis posits that speakers are subject to a communicative pressure to distribute information evenly within utterances, minimising surprisal variance. While this hypothesis has been tested empirically, prior studies are limited exclusively to text-only inputs, abstracting away from the perceptual context in which utterances are produced. In this work, we present the first computational study of UID in visually grounded settings. We estimate surprisal using multilingual vision-and-language models over image-caption data in 30 languages and visual storytelling data in 13 languages, together spanning 11 families. We find that grounding on perception consistently smooths the distribution of information, increasing both global and local uniformity across typologically diverse languages compared to text-only settings. In visual narratives, grounding in both image and discourse contexts has additional effects, with the strongest surprisal reductions occurring at the onset of discourse units. Overall, this study takes a first step towards modelling the temporal dynamics of information flow in ecologically plausible, multimodal language use, and finds that grounded language exhibits greater information uniformity, supporting a context-sensitive formulation of UID.

### GradMAP: Faster Layer Pruning with Gradient Metric and Projection Compensation

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, but their high computational costs limit their practical deployment. Recent studies reveal significant redundancy in LLMs layers, making layer pruning an active research topic. Layer pruning research primarily focuses on two aspects: measuring layer importance and recovering performance after pruning. Unfortunately, the present works fail to simultaneously maintain pruning performance and efficiency. In this study, we propose GradMAP, a faster layer pruning method with \textbf{Grad}ient \textbf{M}etric \textbf{A}nd \textbf{P}rojection compensation, which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we introduce a novel metric based on gradient magnitudes, enabling a global assessment of layer importance. Note that, it requires only a single backward propagation step per pruning decision, substantially enhancing pruning efficiency. In the second stage, we first analyze the layers with the largest mean shift resulting from pruning, and then incorporate a simple yet effective projection compensation matrix to correct this drift in one step. In this way, the degradation of model performance caused by layer pruning is effectively alleviated. Extensive experiments show that GradMAP outperforms previous layer pruning methods in both pruning speed (achieving an average $4\times$ speedup) and performance.

### Alignment Adapter to Improve the Performance of Compressed Deep Learning Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14635v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14635v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14635v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14635v1)

Compressed Deep Learning (DL) models are essential for deployment in resource-constrained environments. But their performance often lags behind their large-scale counterparts. To bridge this gap, we propose Alignment Adapter (AlAd): a lightweight, sliding-window-based adapter. It aligns the token-level embeddings of a compressed model with those of the original large model. AlAd preserves local contextual semantics, enables flexible alignment across differing dimensionalities or architectures, and is entirely agnostic to the underlying compression method. AlAd can be deployed in two ways: as a plug-and-play module over a frozen compressed model, or by jointly fine-tuning AlAd with the compressed model for further performance gains. Through experiments on BERT-family models across three token-level NLP tasks, we demonstrate that AlAd significantly boosts the performance of compressed models with only marginal overhead in size and latency.

### The Wikidata Query Logs Dataset
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14594v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14594v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14594v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14594v1)

2026/02/16 09:49 GTM

We present the Wikidata Query Logs (WDQL) dataset, a dataset consisting of 200k question-query pairs over the Wikidata knowledge graph. It is over 6x larger than the largest existing Wikidata datasets of similar format without relying on template-generated queries. Instead, we construct it using real-world SPARQL queries sent to the Wikidata Query Service and generate questions for them. Since these log-based queries are anonymized, and therefore often do not produce results, a significant amount of effort is needed to convert them back into meaningful SPARQL queries. To achieve this, we present an agent-based method that iteratively de-anonymizes, cleans, and verifies queries against Wikidata while also generating corresponding natural-language questions. We demonstrate the dataset's benefit for training question-answering methods. All WDQL assets, as well as the agent code, are publicly available under a permissive license.

### MATEO: A Multimodal Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning and Planning in LVLMs

AI agents need to plan to achieve complex goals that involve orchestrating perception, sub-goal decomposition, and execution. These plans consist of ordered steps structured according to a Temporal Execution Order (TEO, a directed acyclic graph that ensures each step executes only after its preconditions are satisfied. Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, approximations of the TEO as a linear chain, or text-only inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. Using MATEO, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, varying language context, multimodal input structure, and fine-tuning strategies.

### Assessing Large Language Models for Medical QA: Zero-Shot and LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical domain, especially in developing a QA systems to Medical QA systems for enhancing access to healthcare in low-resourced settings. This paper compares five LLMs deployed between April 2024 and August 2025 for medical QA, using the iCliniq dataset, containing 38,000 medical questions and answers of diverse specialties. Our models include Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Llama 3.2 3B, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct, Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct, and GPT-5-mini. We are using a zero-shot evaluation methodology and using BLEU and ROUGE metrics to evaluate performance without specialized fine-tuning. Our results show that larger models like Llama 3.3 70B Instruct outperform smaller models, consistent with observed scaling benefits in clinical tasks. It is notable that, Llama-4-Maverick-17B exhibited more competitive results, thus highlighting evasion efficiency trade-offs relevant for practical deployment. These findings align with advancements in LLM capabilities toward professional-level medical reasoning and reflect the increasing feasibility of LLM-supported QA systems in the real clinical environments. This benchmark aims to serve as a standardized setting for future study to minimize model size, computational resources and to maximize clinical utility in medical NLP applications.

### Explainable Token-level Noise Filtering for LLM Fine-tuning Datasets
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14536v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14536v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14536v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14536v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advancements, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse applications. Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms.

### Beyond Translation: Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs in Sinhala and Tamil
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14517v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14517v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14517v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14517v1)

Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning in English, but whether these capabilities reflect genuine multilingual reasoning or reliance on translation-based processing in low-resource languages like Sinhala and Tamil remains unclear. We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings.

### Query as Anchor: Scenario-Adaptive User Representation via Large Language Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14492v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14492v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14492v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14492v1)

2026/02/16 06:09 GTM

Industrial-scale user representation learning requires balancing robust universality with acute task-sensitivity. However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness. Our code is prepared for public release and will be available at: https://github.com/JhCircle/Q-Anchor.

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Mixture of Space Experts
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14490v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14490v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14490v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14490v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) emerging as a key technique for downstream task adaptation. However, existing PEFT methods mainly operate in Euclidean space, fundamentally limiting their capacity to capture complex geometric structures inherent in language data. While alternative geometric spaces, like hyperbolic geometries for hierarchical data and spherical manifolds for circular patterns, offer theoretical advantages, forcing representations into a single manifold type ultimately limits expressiveness, even when curvature parameters are learnable. To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS.

### BETA-Labeling for Multilingual Dataset Construction in Low-Resource IR

IR in low-resource languages remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality, task-specific annotated datasets. Manual annotation is expensive and difficult to scale, while using large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators introduces concerns about label reliability, bias, and evaluation validity. This work presents a Bangla IR dataset constructed using a BETA-labeling framework involving multiple LLM annotators from diverse model families. The framework incorporates contextual alignment, consistency checks, and majority agreement, followed by human evaluation to verify label quality. Beyond dataset creation, we examine whether IR datasets from other low-resource languages can be effectively reused through one-hop machine translation. Using LLM-based translation across multiple language pairs, we experimented on meaning preservation and task validity between source and translated datasets. Our experiment reveal substantial variation across languages, reflecting language-dependent biases and inconsistent semantic preservation that directly affect the reliability of cross-lingual dataset reuse. Overall, this study highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-assisted dataset creation for low-resource IR. It provides empirical evidence of the risks associated with cross-lingual dataset reuse and offers practical guidance for constructing more reliable benchmarks and evaluation pipelines in low-resource language settings.

### Neurosim: A Fast Simulator for Neuromorphic Robot Perception

Neurosim is a fast, real-time, high-performance library for simulating sensors such as dynamic vision sensors, RGB cameras, depth sensors, and inertial sensors. It can also simulate agile dynamics of multi-rotor vehicles in complex and dynamic environments. Neurosim can achieve frame rates as high as ~2700 FPS on a desktop GPU. Neurosim integrates with a ZeroMQ-based communication library called Cortex to facilitate seamless integration with machine learning and robotics workflows. Cortex provides a high-throughput, low-latency message-passing system for Python and C++ applications, with native support for NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors. This paper discusses the design philosophy behind Neurosim and Cortex. It demonstrates how they can be used to (i) train neuromorphic perception and control algorithms, e.g., using self-supervised learning on time-synchronized multi-modal data, and (ii) test real-time implementations of these algorithms in closed-loop. Neurosim and Cortex are available at https://github.com/grasp-lyrl/neurosim .

### BPP: Long-Context Robot Imitation Learning by Focusing on Key History Frames

Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations.

### DM0: An Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action Model towards Physical AI
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14974v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14974v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14974v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14974v1)

2026/02/16 17:59 GTM

Moving beyond the traditional paradigm of adapting internet-pretrained models to physical tasks, we present DM0, an Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for Physical AI. Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.

### PhyScensis: Physics-Augmented LLM Agents for Complex Physical Scene Arrangement

Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.

### PAct: Part-Decomposed Single-View Articulated Object Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14965v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.14965v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14965v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.14965v1)

Articulated objects are central to interactive 3D applications, including embodied AI, robotics, and VR/AR, where functional part decomposition and kinematic motion are essential. Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time.

### Morphing of and writing with a scissor linkage mechanism

Kinematics of mechanisms is intricately coupled to their geometry and their utility often arises out of the ability to perform reproducible motion with fewer actuating degrees of freedom. In this article, we explore the assembly of scissor-units, each made of two rigid linear members connected by a pin joint. The assembly has a single degree of freedom, where actuating any single unit results in a shape change of the entire assembly. We derive expressions for the effective curvature of the unit and the trajectory of the mechanism's tip as a function of the geometric variables which we then use as the basis to program two tasks in the mechanism: shape morphing and writing. By phrasing these tasks as optimization problems and utilizing the differentiable simulation framework, we arrive at solutions that are then tested in table-top experiments. Our results show that the geometry of scissor assemblies can be leveraged for automated navigation and inspection in complex domains, in light of the optimization framework. However, we highlight that the challenges associated with rapid programming and error-free implementation in experiments without feedback still remain.

### Kalman Filtering Based Flight Management System Modeling for AAM Aircraft

Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM) operations require strategic flight planning services that predict both spatial and temporal uncertainties to safely validate flight plans against hazards such as weather cells, restricted airspaces, and CNS disruption areas. Current uncertainty estimation methods for AAM vehicles rely on conservative linear models due to limited real-world performance data. This paper presents a novel Kalman Filter-based uncertainty propagation method that models AAM Flight Management System (FMS) architectures through sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance. Unlike existing approaches with fixed uncertainty thresholds, our method continuously adapts the filter's measurement trust based on progress toward waypoints, enabling FMS correction behavior to emerge naturally. The approach scales proportionally with control inputs and is tunable to match specific aircraft characteristics or route conditions. We validate the method using real ADS-B data from general aviation aircraft divided into training and verification sets. Uncertainty propagation parameters were tuned on the training set, achieving 76% accuracy in predicting arrival times when compared against the verification dataset, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for strategic flight plan validation in AAM operations.

### Affordance Transfer Across Object Instances via Semantically Anchored Functional Map

Traditional learning from demonstration (LfD) generally demands a cumbersome collection of physical demonstrations, which can be time-consuming and challenging to scale. Recent advances show that robots can instead learn from human videos by extracting interaction cues without direct robot involvement. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to generalize demonstrated interactions across different object instances that share similar functionality but vary significantly in geometry. In this work, we propose \emph{Semantic Anchored Functional Maps} (SemFM), a framework for transferring affordances across objects from a single visual demonstration. Starting from a coarse mesh reconstructed from an image, our method identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, and propagates these constraints over the surface using a functional map to obtain a dense, semantically consistent correspondence. This enables demonstrated interaction regions to be transferred across geometrically diverse objects in a lightweight and interpretable manner. Experiments on synthetic object categories and real-world robotic manipulation tasks show that our approach enables accurate affordance transfer with modest computational cost, making it well-suited for practical robotic perception-to-action pipelines.

### Scalable Multi-Robot Path Planning via Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization

Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, where classical centralized approaches exhibit exponential growth in joint-state complexity as the number of agents increases. This paper investigates Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) as a structurally scalable alternative for simultaneous multi-robot path planning. This approach is a robotics-oriented QUBO formulation incorporating BFS-based logical pre-processing (achieving over 95% variable reduction), adaptive penalty design for collision and constraint enforcement, and a time-windowed decomposition strategy that enables execution within current hardware limitations. An experimental evaluation in grid environments with up to four robots demonstrated near-optimal solutions in dense scenarios and favorable scaling behavior compared to sequential classical planning. These results establish a practical and reproducible baseline for future quantum and quantum-inspired multi-robot coordinations.

### Analysis of a Cuspidal 6R Robot

We present a theoretical and numerical analysis of the kinematics for the "Transpressor", a cuspidal 6R robot. It admits up to 16 inverse kinematics solutions which are described geometrically. For special target poses, we provide the solutions analytically and present a simple numerical solver for the general case. Moreover, an analytical estimate of the Jacobian determinant on a path between two solutions proves cuspidality for a class of robots similar to the transpressor.

We present ROSA -- Roundabout Optimized Speed Advisory -- a system that combines multi-agent trajectory prediction with coordinated speed guidance for multimodal, mixed traffic at roundabouts. Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective.

Autonomous control of double-Ackermann-steering robots is essential in agricultural applications, where robots must execute precise and complex maneuvers within a limited space. Classical methods, such as the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner, can address this problem, but they rely on parameter tuning, making them highly sensitive to changes in robot configuration or environment and impractical to deploy without constant recalibration. At the same time, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, resulting in sub-optimal policies and poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper presents ManeuverNet, a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems, combining Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. Furthermore, ManeuverNet introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning. Unlike prior work, ManeuverNet does not depend on expert data or handcrafted guidance. We extensively evaluate ManeuverNet against both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and the TEB planner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines. Moreover, ManeuverNet effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity observed in the TEB planner. In real-world trials, ManeuverNet achieved up to a 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.

Endoluminal surgery offers a minimally invasive option for early-stage gastrointestinal and urinary tract cancers but is limited by surgical tools and a steep learning curve. Robotic systems, particularly continuum robots, provide flexible instruments that enable precise tissue resection, potentially improving outcomes. This paper presents a visual perception platform for a continuum robotic system in endoluminal surgery. Our goal is to utilize monocular endoscopic image-based perception algorithms to identify position and orientation of flexible instruments and measure their distances from tissues. We introduce 2D and 3D learning-based perception algorithms and develop a physically-realistic simulator that models flexible instruments dynamics. This simulator generates realistic endoluminal scenes, enabling control of flexible robots and substantial data collection. Using a continuum robot prototype, we conducted module and system-level evaluations. Results show that our algorithms improve control of flexible instruments, reducing manipulation time by over 70% for trajectory-following tasks and enhancing understanding of surgical scenarios, leading to robust endoluminal surgeries.

Global solvers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D vision, offering certifiable solutions to nonconvex geometric optimization problems traditionally addressed by local or heuristic methods. This survey presents the first systematic review of global solvers in geometric vision, unifying the field through a comprehensive taxonomy of three core paradigms: Branch-and-Bound (BnB), Convex Relaxation (CR), and Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). We present their theoretical foundations, algorithmic designs, and practical enhancements for robustness and scalability, examining how each addresses the fundamental nonconvexity of geometric estimation problems. Our analysis spans ten core vision tasks, from Wahba problem to bundle adjustment, revealing the optimality-robustness-scalability trade-offs that govern solver selection. We identify critical future directions: scaling algorithms while maintaining guarantees, integrating data-driven priors with certifiable optimization, establishing standardized benchmarks, and addressing societal implications for safety-critical deployment. By consolidating theoretical foundations, practical advances, and broader impacts, this survey provides a unified perspective and roadmap toward certifiable, trustworthy perception for real-world applications.

This paper presents a simulation-driven approach for automating the force-controlled assembly of electrical terminals on DIN-rails, a task traditionally hindered by high programming effort and product variability. The proposed method integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with parameterizable robot skills in a physics-based simulation environment. To realistically model the snap-fit assembly process, we develop and evaluate two types of joining models: analytical models based on beam theory and rigid-body models implemented in the MuJoCo physics engine. These models enable accurate simulation of interaction forces, essential for training DRL agents. The robot skills are structured using the pitasc framework, allowing modular, reusable control strategies. Training is conducted in simulation using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms. Domain randomization is applied to improve robustness. The trained policies are transferred to a physical UR10e robot system without additional tuning. Experimental results demonstrate high success rates (up to 100%) in both simulation and real-world settings, even under significant positional and rotational deviations. The system generalizes well to new terminal types and positions, significantly reducing manual programming effort. This work highlights the potential of combining simulation-based learning with modular robot skills for flexible, scalable automation in small-batch manufacturing. Future work will explore hybrid learning methods, automated environment parameterization, and further refinement of joining models for design integration.

### Replanning Human-Robot Collaborative Tasks with Vision-Language Models via Semantic and Physical Dual-Correction

Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility.

### Multimodal Covariance Steering in Belief Space with Active Probing and Influence for Autonomous Driving

Autonomous driving in complex traffic requires reasoning under uncertainty. Common approaches rely on prediction-based planning or risk-aware control, but these are typically treated in isolation, limiting their ability to capture the coupled nature of action and inference in interactive settings. This gap becomes especially critical in uncertain scenarios, where simply reacting to predictions can lead to unsafe maneuvers or overly conservative behavior. Our central insight is that safe interaction requires not only estimating human behavior but also shaping it when ambiguity poses risks. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical belief model that structures human behavior across coarse discrete intents and fine motion modes, updated via Bayesian inference for interpretable multi-resolution reasoning. On top of this, we develop an active probing strategy that identifies when multimodal ambiguity in human predictions may compromise safety and plans disambiguating actions that both reveal intent and gently steer human decisions toward safer outcomes. Finally, a runtime risk-evaluation layer based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ensures that all probing actions remain within human risk tolerance during influence. Our simulations in lane-merging and unsignaled intersection scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates and shorter completion times compared to existing methods. These results highlight the benefit of coupling belief inference, probing, and risk monitoring, yielding a principled and interpretable framework for planning under uncertainty.

### TWISTED-RL: Hierarchical Skilled Agents for Knot-Tying without Human Demonstrations

Robotic knot-tying represents a fundamental challenge in robotics due to the complex interactions between deformable objects and strict topological constraints. We present TWISTED-RL, a framework that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art in demonstration-free knot-tying (TWISTED), which smartly decomposed a single knot-tying problem into manageable subproblems, each addressed by a specialized agent. Our approach replaces TWISTED's single-step inverse model that was learned via supervised learning with a multi-step Reinforcement Learning policy conditioned on abstract topological actions rather than goal states. This change allows more delicate topological state transitions while avoiding costly and ineffective data collection protocols, thus enabling better generalization across diverse knot configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that TWISTED-RL manages to solve previously unattainable knots of higher complexity, including commonly used knots such as the Figure-8 and the Overhand. Furthermore, the increase in success rates and drop in planning time establishes TWISTED-RL as the new state-of-the-art in robotic knot-tying without human demonstrations.
