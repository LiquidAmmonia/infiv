### DiffusionBrowser: Interactive Diffusion Previews via Multi-Branch Decoders
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13690v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13690v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13690v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13690v1)

Video diffusion models have revolutionized generative video synthesis, but they are imprecise, slow, and can be opaque during generation -- keeping users in the dark for a prolonged period. In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process. Our model can generate multi-modal preview representations that include RGB and scene intrinsics at more than 4$\times$ real-time speed (less than 1 second for a 4-second video) that convey consistent appearance and motion to the final video. With the trained decoder, we show that it is possible to interactively guide the generation at intermediate noise steps via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, unlocking a new control capability. Moreover, we systematically probe the model using the learned decoders, revealing how scene, object, and other details are composed and assembled during the otherwise black-box denoising process.

### LitePT: Lighter Yet Stronger Point Transformer

Modern neural architectures for 3D point cloud processing contain both convolutional layers and attention blocks, but the best way to assemble them remains unclear. We analyse the role of different computational blocks in 3D point cloud networks and find an intuitive behaviour: convolution is adequate to extract low-level geometry at high-resolution in early layers, where attention is expensive without bringing any benefits; attention captures high-level semantics and context in low-resolution, deep layers more efficiently. Guided by this design principle, we propose a new, improved 3D point cloud backbone that employs convolutions in early stages and switches to attention for deeper layers. To avoid the loss of spatial layout information when discarding redundant convolution layers, we introduce a novel, training-free 3D positional encoding, PointROPE. The resulting LitePT model has $3.6\times$ fewer parameters, runs $2\times$ faster, and uses $2\times$ less memory than the state-of-the-art Point Transformer V3, but nonetheless matches or even outperforms it on a range of tasks and datasets. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/prs-eth/LitePT.

### Towards Scalable Pre-training of Visual Tokenizers for Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13687v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13687v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13687v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13687v1)

The quality of the latent space in visual tokenizers (e.g., VAEs) is crucial for modern generative models. However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS. Our pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/VTP.

### Recurrent Video Masked Autoencoders
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13684v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13684v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13684v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13684v1)

2025/12/15 18:59 GTM

We present Recurrent Video Masked-Autoencoders (RVM): a novel video representation learning approach that uses a transformer-based recurrent neural network to aggregate dense image features over time, effectively capturing the spatio-temporal structure of natural video data. RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.

### I-Scene: 3D Instance Models are Implicit Generalizable Spatial Learners
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13683v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13683v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13683v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13683v1)

Generalization remains the central challenge for interactive 3D scene generation. Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts. We instead reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene level learner, replacing dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

### LASER: Layer-wise Scale Alignment for Training-Free Streaming 4D Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13680v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13680v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13680v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13680v1)

Recent feed-forward reconstruction models like VGGT and $π^3$ achieve impressive reconstruction quality but cannot process streaming videos due to quadratic memory complexity, limiting their practical deployment. While existing streaming methods address this through learned memory mechanisms or causal attention, they require extensive retraining and may not fully leverage the strong geometric priors of state-of-the-art offline models. We propose LASER, a training-free framework that converts an offline reconstruction model into a streaming system by aligning predictions across consecutive temporal windows. We observe that simple similarity transformation ($\mathrm{Sim}(3)$) alignment fails due to layer depth misalignment: monocular scale ambiguity causes relative depth scales of different scene layers to vary inconsistently between windows. To address this, we introduce layer-wise scale alignment, which segments depth predictions into discrete layers, computes per-layer scale factors, and propagates them across both adjacent windows and timestamps. Extensive experiments show that LASER achieves state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and point map reconstruction %quality with offline models while operating at 14 FPS with 6 GB peak memory on a RTX A6000 GPU, enabling practical deployment for kilometer-scale streaming videos.

### Feedforward 3D Editing via Text-Steerable Image-to-3D
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13678v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13678v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13678v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13678v1)

Recent progress in image-to-3D has opened up immense possibilities for design, AR/VR, and robotics. However, to use AI-generated 3D assets in real applications, a critical requirement is the capability to edit them easily. We present a feedforward method, Steer3D, to add text steerability to image-to-3D models, which enables editing of generated 3D assets with language. Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass. We build a scalable data engine for automatic data generation, and develop a two-stage training recipe based on flow-matching training and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Compared to competing methods, Steer3D more faithfully follows the language instruction and maintains better consistency with the original 3D asset, while being 2.4x to 28.5x faster. Steer3D demonstrates that it is possible to add a new modality (text) to steer the generation of pretrained image-to-3D generative models with 100k data.

### JoVA: Unified Multimodal Learning for Joint Video-Audio Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13677v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13677v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13677v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13677v1)

2025/12/15 18:58 GTM

In this paper, we present JoVA, a unified framework for joint video-audio generation. Despite recent encouraging advances, existing methods face two critical limitations. First, most existing approaches can only generate ambient sounds and lack the capability to produce human speech synchronized with lip movements. Second, recent attempts at unified human video-audio generation typically rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules, which introduce additional architecture design and weaken the model simplicity of the original transformers. To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that JoVA outperforms or is competitive with both unified and audio-driven state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity. Our results establish JoVA as an elegant framework for high-quality multimodal generation.

### Towards Interactive Intelligence for Digital Humans
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13674v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13674v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13674v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13674v1)

2025/12/15 18:57 GTM

We introduce Interactive Intelligence, a novel paradigm of digital human that is capable of personality-aligned expression, adaptive interaction, and self-evolution. To realize this, we present Mio (Multimodal Interactive Omni-Avatar), an end-to-end framework composed of five specialized modules: Thinker, Talker, Face Animator, Body Animator, and Renderer. This unified architecture integrates cognitive reasoning with real-time multimodal embodiment to enable fluid, consistent interaction. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of interactive intelligence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated dimensions. Together, these contributions move digital humans beyond superficial imitation toward intelligent interaction.

### Directional Textual Inversion for Personalized Text-to-Image Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13672v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13672v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13672v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13672v1)

2025/12/15 18:57 GTM

Textual Inversion (TI) is an efficient approach to text-to-image personalization but often fails on complex prompts. We trace these failures to embedding norm inflation: learned tokens drift to out-of-distribution magnitudes, degrading prompt conditioning in pre-norm Transformers. Empirically, we show semantics are primarily encoded by direction in CLIP token space, while inflated norms harm contextualization; theoretically, we analyze how large magnitudes attenuate positional information and hinder residual updates in pre-norm blocks. We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity. Crucially, DTI's hyperspherical parameterization enables smooth, semantically coherent interpolation between learned concepts (slerp), a capability that is absent in standard TI. Our findings suggest that direction-only optimization is a robust and scalable path for prompt-faithful personalization.

### AgentIAD: Tool-Augmented Single-Agent for Industrial Anomaly Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13671v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13671v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13671v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13671v1)

2025/12/15 18:57 GTM

Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is difficult due to the scarcity of normal reference samples and the subtle, localized nature of many defects. Single-pass vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook small abnormalities and lack explicit mechanisms to compare against canonical normal patterns. We propose AgentIAD, a tool-driven agentic framework that enables multi-stage visual inspection. The agent is equipped with a Perceptive Zoomer (PZ) for localized fine-grained analysis and a Comparative Retriever (CR) for querying normal exemplars when evidence is ambiguous. To teach these inspection behaviors, we construct structured perceptive and comparative trajectories from the MMAD dataset and train the model in two stages: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. A two-part reward design drives this process: a perception reward that supervises classification accuracy, spatial alignment, and type correctness, and a behavior reward that encourages efficient tool use. Together, these components enable the model to refine its judgment through step-wise observation, zooming, and verification. AgentIAD achieves a new state-of-the-art 97.62% classification accuracy on MMAD, surpassing prior MLLM-based approaches while producing transparent and interpretable inspection traces.

### Grab-3D: Detecting AI-Generated Videos from 3D Geometric Temporal Consistency
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13665v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13665v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13665v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13665v1)

2025/12/15 18:54 GTM

Recent advances in diffusion-based generation techniques enable AI models to produce highly realistic videos, heightening the need for reliable detection mechanisms. However, existing detection methods provide only limited exploration of the 3D geometric patterns present in generated videos. In this paper, we use vanishing points as an explicit representation of 3D geometry patterns, revealing fundamental discrepancies in geometric consistency between real and AI-generated videos. We introduce Grab-3D, a geometry-aware transformer framework for detecting AI-generated videos based on 3D geometric temporal consistency. To enable reliable evaluation, we construct an AI-generated video dataset of static scenes, allowing stable 3D geometric feature extraction. We propose a geometry-aware transformer equipped with geometric positional encoding, temporal-geometric attention, and an EMA-based geometric classifier head to explicitly inject 3D geometric awareness into temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that Grab-3D significantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, achieving robust cross-domain generalization to unseen generators.

### RoboTracer: Mastering Spatial Trace with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13660v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13660v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13660v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13660v1)

2025/12/15 18:52 GTM

Spatial tracing, as a fundamental embodied interaction ability for robots, is inherently challenging as it requires multi-step metric-grounded reasoning compounded with complex spatial referring and real-world metric measurement. However, existing methods struggle with this compositional task. To this end, we propose RoboTracer, a 3D-aware VLM that first achieves both 3D spatial referring and measuring via a universal spatial encoder and a regression-supervised decoder to enhance scale awareness during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboTracer advances multi-step metric-grounded reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with metric-sensitive process rewards, supervising key intermediate perceptual cues to accurately generate spatial traces. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce TraceSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, spanning outdoor/indoor/tabletop scenes and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 9 steps). We further present TraceSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap to evaluate spatial tracing. Experimental results show that RoboTracer surpasses baselines in spatial understanding, measuring, and referring, with an average success rate of 79.1%, and also achieves SOTA performance on TraceSpatial-Bench by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 36% accuracy. Notably, RoboTracer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

### World Models Can Leverage Human Videos for Dexterous Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13644v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13644v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13644v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13644v1)

2025/12/15 18:37 GTM

Dexterous manipulation is challenging because it requires understanding how subtle hand motion influences the environment through contact with objects. We introduce DexWM, a Dexterous Manipulation World Model that predicts the next latent state of the environment conditioned on past states and dexterous actions. To overcome the scarcity of dexterous manipulation datasets, DexWM is trained on over 900 hours of human and non-dexterous robot videos. To enable fine-grained dexterity, we find that predicting visual features alone is insufficient; therefore, we introduce an auxiliary hand consistency loss that enforces accurate hand configurations. DexWM outperforms prior world models conditioned on text, navigation, and full-body actions, achieving more accurate predictions of future states. DexWM also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen manipulation skills when deployed on a Franka Panda arm equipped with an Allegro gripper, outperforming Diffusion Policy by over 50% on average in grasping, placing, and reaching tasks.

### From Code to Field: Evaluating the Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks for Disease Diagnosis in Mango Leaves
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13641v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13641v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13641v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13641v1)

2025/12/15 18:36 GTM

The validation and verification of artificial intelligence (AI) models through robustness assessment are essential to guarantee the reliable performance of intelligent systems facing real-world challenges, such as image corruptions including noise, blurring, and weather variations. Despite the global importance of mango (Mangifera indica L.), there is a lack of studies on the robustness of models for the diagnosis of disease in its leaves. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that lightweight and specialized models may be more suitable for real-world applications in edge devices, where robustness and efficiency are critical. The study highlights the need to incorporate robustness assessments in the development of intelligent systems for agriculture, particularly in regions with technological limitations.

### Charge: A Comprehensive Novel View Synthesis Benchmark and Dataset to Bind Them All
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13639v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13639v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13639v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13639v1)

2025/12/15 18:33 GTM

This paper presents a new dataset for Novel View Synthesis, generated from a high-quality, animated film with stunning realism and intricate detail. Our dataset captures a variety of dynamic scenes, complete with detailed textures, lighting, and motion, making it ideal for training and evaluating cutting-edge 4D scene reconstruction and novel view generation models. In addition to high-fidelity RGB images, we provide multiple complementary modalities, including depth, surface normals, object segmentation and optical flow, enabling a deeper understanding of scene geometry and motion. The dataset is organised into three distinct benchmarking scenarios: a dense multi-view camera setup, a sparse camera arrangement, and monocular video sequences, enabling a wide range of experimentation and comparison across varying levels of data sparsity. With its combination of visual richness, high-quality annotations, and diverse experimental setups, this dataset offers a unique resource for pushing the boundaries of view synthesis and 3D vision.

### MindDrive: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Autonomous Driving via Online Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13636v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13636v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13636v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13636v1)

2025/12/15 18:31 GTM

Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.

### SCR2-ST: Combine Single Cell with Spatial Transcriptomics for Efficient Active Sampling via Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13635v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13635v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13635v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13635v1)

2025/12/15 18:30 GTM

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that enables researchers to investigate the molecular relationships underlying tissue morphology. However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hrlblab/SCR2ST

### Do-Undo: Generating and Reversing Physical Actions in Vision-Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13609v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13609v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13609v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13609v1)

2025/12/15 18:03 GTM

We introduce the Do-Undo task and benchmark to address a critical gap in vision-language models: understanding and generating physically plausible scene transformations driven by real-world actions. Unlike prior work focused on object-level edits, Do-Undo requires models to simulate the outcome of a physical action and then accurately reverse it, reflecting true cause-and-effect in the visual world. We curate a large-scale dataset of reversible actions from real-world videos and design a training strategy enforcing consistency for robust action grounding. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle with physical reversibility, underscoring the importance of this task for embodied AI, robotics, and physics-aware generative modeling. Do-Undo establishes an intuitive testbed for evaluating and advancing physical reasoning in multimodal systems.

### DBT-DINO: Towards Foundation model based analysis of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13608v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13608v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13608v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13608v1)

2025/12/15 18:03 GTM

Foundation models have shown promise in medical imaging but remain underexplored for three-dimensional imaging modalities. No foundation model currently exists for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), despite its use for breast cancer screening.
  To develop and evaluate a foundation model for DBT (DBT-DINO) across multiple clinical tasks and assess the impact of domain-specific pre-training.
  Self-supervised pre-training was performed using the DINOv2 methodology on over 25 million 2D slices from 487,975 DBT volumes from 27,990 patients. Three downstream tasks were evaluated: (1) breast density classification using 5,000 screening exams; (2) 5-year risk of developing breast cancer using 106,417 screening exams; and (3) lesion detection using 393 annotated volumes.
  For breast density classification, DBT-DINO achieved an accuracy of 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.81), outperforming both the MetaAI DINOv2 baseline (0.73, 95\% CI: 0.70--0.76, p<.001) and DenseNet-121 (0.74, 95\% CI: 0.71--0.76, p<.001). For 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, DBT-DINO achieved an AUROC of 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.80) compared to DINOv2's 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.74--0.78, p=.57). For lesion detection, DINOv2 achieved a higher average sensitivity of 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.60--0.74) compared to DBT-DINO with 0.62 (95\% CI: 0.53--0.71, p=.60). DBT-DINO demonstrated better performance on cancerous lesions specifically with a detection rate of 78.8\% compared to Dinov2's 77.3\%.
  Using a dataset of unprecedented size, we developed DBT-DINO, the first foundation model for DBT. DBT-DINO demonstrated strong performance on breast density classification and cancer risk prediction. However, domain-specific pre-training showed variable benefits on the detection task, with ImageNet baseline outperforming DBT-DINO on general lesion detection, indicating that localized detection tasks require further methodological development.

Building video world models upon pretrained video generation systems represents an important yet challenging step toward general spatiotemporal intelligence. A world model should possess three essential properties: controllability, long-term visual quality, and temporal consistency. To this end, we take a progressive approach-first enhancing controllability and then extending toward long-term, high-quality generation. We present LongVie 2, an end-to-end autoregressive framework trained in three stages: (1) Multi-modal guidance, which integrates dense and sparse control signals to provide implicit world-level supervision and improve controllability; (2) Degradation-aware training on the input frame, bridging the gap between training and long-term inference to maintain high visual quality; and (3) History-context guidance, which aligns contextual information across adjacent clips to ensure temporal consistency. We further introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 high-resolution one-minute videos covering diverse real-world and synthetic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LongVie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity, and supports continuous video generation lasting up to five minutes, marking a significant step toward unified video world modeling.

### DA-SSL: self-supervised domain adaptor to leverage foundational models in turbt histopathology slides
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13600v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13600v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13600v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13600v1)

Recent deep learning frameworks in histopathology, particularly multiple instance learning (MIL) combined with pathology foundational models (PFMs), have shown strong performance. However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting. Our results demonstrate that lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision can effectively enhance PFM-based MIL pipelines for clinically challenging histopathology tasks.

### Lighting in Motion: Spatiotemporal HDR Lighting Estimation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13597v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13597v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13597v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13597v1)

We present Lighting in Motion (LiMo), a diffusion-based approach to spatiotemporal lighting estimation. LiMo targets both realistic high-frequency detail prediction and accurate illuminance estimation. To account for both, we propose generating a set of mirrored and diffuse spheres at different exposures, based on their 3D positions in the input. Making use of diffusion priors, we fine-tune powerful existing diffusion models on a large-scale customized dataset of indoor and outdoor scenes, paired with spatiotemporal light probes. For accurate spatial conditioning, we demonstrate that depth alone is insufficient and we introduce a new geometric condition to provide the relative position of the scene to the target 3D position. Finally, we combine diffuse and mirror predictions at different exposures into a single HDRI map leveraging differentiable rendering. We thoroughly evaluate our method and design choices to establish LiMo as state-of-the-art for both spatial control and prediction accuracy.

### Image Diffusion Preview with Consistency Solver
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13592v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13592v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13592v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13592v1)

2025/12/15 17:47 GTM

The slow inference process of image diffusion models significantly degrades interactive user experiences. To address this, we introduce Diffusion Preview, a novel paradigm employing rapid, low-step sampling to generate preliminary outputs for user evaluation, deferring full-step refinement until the preview is deemed satisfactory. Existing acceleration methods, including training-free solvers and post-training distillation, struggle to deliver high-quality previews or ensure consistency between previews and final outputs. We propose ConsistencySolver derived from general linear multistep methods, a lightweight, trainable high-order solver optimized via Reinforcement Learning, that enhances preview quality and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that ConsistencySolver significantly improves generation quality and consistency in low-step scenarios, making it ideal for efficient preview-and-refine workflows. Notably, it achieves FID scores on-par with Multistep DPM-Solver using 47% fewer steps, while outperforming distillation baselines. Furthermore, user studies indicate our approach reduces overall user interaction time by nearly 50% while maintaining generation quality. Code is available at https://github.com/G-U-N/consolver.

### MMhops-R1: Multimodal Multi-hop Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13573v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13573v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13573v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13573v1)

The ability to perform multi-modal multi-hop reasoning by iteratively integrating information across various modalities and external knowledge is critical for addressing complex real-world challenges. However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach. In conclusion, our work contributes a challenging new benchmark and a powerful baseline model, and we will release the associated code, data, and weights to catalyze future research in this critical area.

### 3D Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13560v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13560v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13560v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13560v1)

Human-centric anomaly detection (AD) has been primarily studied to specify anomalous behaviors in a single person. However, as humans by nature tend to act in a collaborative manner, behavioral anomalies can also arise from human-human interactions. Detecting such anomalies using existing single-person AD models is prone to low accuracy, as these approaches are typically not designed to capture the complex and asymmetric dynamics of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection (H2IAD), which aims to identify anomalous interactive behaviors within collaborative 3D human actions. To address H2IAD, we then propose Interaction Anomaly Detection Network (IADNet), which is formalized with a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM). Specifically, in designing TASM, we share the encoded motion embeddings across both people such that collaborative motion correlations can be effectively synchronized. Moreover, we notice that in addition to temporal dynamics, human interactions are also characterized by spatial configurations between two people. We thus introduce a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to better reflect social cues in H2IAD. The normalizing flow is eventually employed for anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments on human-human motion benchmarks demonstrate that IADNet outperforms existing Human-centric AD baselines in H2IAD.

### Pancakes: Consistent Multi-Protocol Image Segmentation Across Biomedical Domains
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13534v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13534v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13534v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13534v1)

A single biomedical image can be meaningfully segmented in multiple ways, depending on the desired application. For instance, a brain MRI can be segmented according to tissue types, vascular territories, broad anatomical regions, fine-grained anatomy, or pathology, etc. Existing automatic segmentation models typically either (1) support only a single protocol, the one they were trained on, or (2) require labor-intensive manual prompting to specify the desired segmentation. We introduce Pancakes, a framework that, given a new image from a previously unseen domain, automatically generates multi-label segmentation maps for multiple plausible protocols, while maintaining semantic consistency across related images. Pancakes introduces a new problem formulation that is not currently attainable by existing foundation models. In a series of experiments on seven held-out datasets, we demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform existing foundation models in producing several plausible whole-image segmentations, that are semantically coherent across images.

### TARA: Simple and Efficient Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation of MLLMs for Video Understanding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13511v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13511v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13511v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13511v1)

2025/12/15 16:38 GTM

Our objective is to build a general time-aware video-text embedding model for retrieval. To that end, we propose a simple and efficient recipe, dubbed TARA (Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation), to adapt Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to a time-aware video-text embedding model without using any video data at all. For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we discover additional benefits of TARA beyond time-awareness: (i) TARA embeddings are negation-aware as shown in NegBench benchmark that evaluates negation in video retrieval, (ii) TARA achieves state of the art performance on verb and adverb understanding in videos. Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance.

### Seedance 1.5 pro: A Native Audio-Visual Joint Generation Foundation Model

Recent strides in video generation have paved the way for unified audio-visual generation. In this work, we present Seedance 1.5 pro, a foundational model engineered specifically for native, joint audio-video generation. Leveraging a dual-branch Diffusion Transformer architecture, the model integrates a cross-modal joint module with a specialized multi-stage data pipeline, achieving exceptional audio-visual synchronization and superior generation quality. To ensure practical utility, we implement meticulous post-training optimizations, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on high-quality datasets and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with multi-dimensional reward models. Furthermore, we introduce an acceleration framework that boosts inference speed by over 10X. Seedance 1.5 pro distinguishes itself through precise multilingual and dialect lip-syncing, dynamic cinematic camera control, and enhanced narrative coherence, positioning it as a robust engine for professional-grade content creation. Seedance 1.5 pro is now accessible on Volcano Engine at https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/experience/vision?type=GenVideo.

### On-Device Continual Learning for Unsupervised Visual Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Manufacturing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13497v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13497v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13497v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13497v1)

2025/12/15 16:27 GTM

In modern manufacturing, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for automated inspection and consistent product quality. Yet, increasingly dynamic and flexible production environments introduce key challenges: First, frequent product changes in small-batch and on-demand manufacturing require rapid model updates. Second, legacy edge hardware lacks the resources to train and run large AI models. Finally, both anomalous and normal training data are often scarce, particularly for newly introduced product variations. We investigate on-device continual learning for unsupervised VAD with localization, extending the PatchCore to incorporate online learning for real-world industrial scenarios. The proposed method leverages a lightweight feature extractor and an incremental coreset update mechanism based on k-center selection, enabling rapid, memory-efficient adaptation from limited data while eliminating costly cloud retraining. Evaluations on an industrial use case are conducted using a testbed designed to emulate flexible production with frequent variant changes in a controlled environment. Our method achieves a 12% AUROC improvement over the baseline, an 80% reduction in memory usage, and faster training compared to batch retraining. These results confirm that our method delivers accurate, resource-efficient, and adaptive VAD suitable for dynamic and smart manufacturing.

### Soul: Breathe Life into Digital Human for High-fidelity Long-term Multimodal Animation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13495v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13495v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13495v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13495v1)

2025/12/15 16:25 GTM

We propose a multimodal-driven framework for high-fidelity long-term digital human animation termed $\textbf{Soul}$, which generates semantically coherent videos from a single-frame portrait image, text prompts, and audio, achieving precise lip synchronization, vivid facial expressions, and robust identity preservation. We construct Soul-1M, containing 1 million finely annotated samples with a precise automated annotation pipeline (covering portrait, upper-body, full-body, and multi-person scenes) to mitigate data scarcity, and we carefully curate Soul-Bench for comprehensive and fair evaluation of audio-/text-guided animation methods. The model is built on the Wan2.2-5B backbone, integrating audio-injection layers and multiple training strategies together with threshold-aware codebook replacement to ensure long-term generation consistency. Meanwhile, step/CFG distillation and a lightweight VAE are used to optimize inference efficiency, achieving an 11.4$\times$ speedup with negligible quality loss. Extensive experiments show that Soul significantly outperforms current leading open-source and commercial models on video quality, video-text alignment, identity preservation, and lip-synchronization accuracy, demonstrating broad applicability in real-world scenarios such as virtual anchors and film production.

### Transform Trained Transformer: Accelerating Naive 4K Video Generation Over 10$\times$
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13492v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13492v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13492v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13492v1)

2025/12/15 16:25 GTM

Native 4K (2160$\times$3840) video generation remains a critical challenge due to the quadratic computational explosion of full-attention as spatiotemporal resolution increases, making it difficult for models to strike a balance between efficiency and quality. This paper proposes a novel Transformer retrofit strategy termed $\textbf{T3}$ ($\textbf{T}$ransform $\textbf{T}$rained $\textbf{T}$ransformer) that, without altering the core architecture of full-attention pretrained models, significantly reduces compute requirements by optimizing their forward logic. Specifically, $\textbf{T3-Video}$ introduces a multi-scale weight-sharing window attention mechanism and, via hierarchical blocking together with an axis-preserving full-attention design, can effect an "attention pattern" transformation of a pretrained model using only modest compute and data. Results on 4K-VBench show that $\textbf{T3-Video}$ substantially outperforms existing approaches: while delivering performance improvements (+4.29$\uparrow$ VQA and +0.08$\uparrow$ VTC), it accelerates native 4K video generation by more than 10$\times$.

### PoseAnything: Universal Pose-guided Video Generation with Part-aware Temporal Coherence
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13465v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13465v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13465v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13465v1)

Pose-guided video generation refers to controlling the motion of subjects in generated video through a sequence of poses. It enables precise control over subject motion and has important applications in animation. However, current pose-guided video generation methods are limited to accepting only human poses as input, thus generalizing poorly to pose of other subjects. To address this issue, we propose PoseAnything, the first universal pose-guided video generation framework capable of handling both human and non-human characters, supporting arbitrary skeletal inputs. To enhance consistency preservation during motion, we introduce Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module, which divides the subject into different parts, establishes part correspondences, and computes cross-attention between corresponding parts across frames to achieve fine-grained part-level consistency. Additionally, we propose Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG, a novel guidance strategy that, for the first time, enables independent camera movement control in pose-guided video generation, by separately injecting subject and camera motion control information into the positive and negative anchors of CFG. Furthermore, we present XPose, a high-quality public dataset containing 50,000 non-human pose-video pairs, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pose-Anything significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

### Test-Time Modification: Inverse Domain Transformation for Robust Perception

Generative foundation models contain broad visual knowledge and can produce diverse image variations, making them particularly promising for advancing domain generalization tasks. While they can be used for training data augmentation, synthesizing comprehensive target-domain variations remains slow, expensive, and incomplete. We propose an alternative: using diffusion models at test time to map target images back to the source distribution where the downstream model was trained. This approach requires only a source domain description, preserves the task model, and eliminates large-scale synthetic data generation. We demonstrate consistent improvements across segmentation, detection, and classification tasks under challenging environmental shifts in real-to-real domain generalization scenarios with unknown target distributions. Our analysis spans multiple generative and downstream models, including an ensemble variant for enhanced robustness. The method achieves substantial relative gains: 137% on BDD100K-Night, 68% on ImageNet-R, and 62% on DarkZurich.

### IMILIA: interpretable multiple instance learning for inflammation prediction in IBD from H&E whole slide images
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13440v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13440v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13440v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13440v1)

As the therapeutic target for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) shifts toward histologic remission, the accurate assessment of microscopic inflammation has become increasingly central for evaluating disease activity and response to treatment. In this work, we introduce IMILIA (Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Inflammation Analysis), an end-to-end framework designed for the prediction of inflammation presence in IBD digitized slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), followed by the automated computation of markers characterizing tissue regions driving the predictions. IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells. Notably, these patterns were consistent across all datasets. Code and models to partially replicate the results on the public IBDColEpi dataset can be found at https://github.com/owkin/imilia.

### Self-Supervised Ultrasound Representation Learning for Renal Anomaly Prediction in Prenatal Imaging
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13434v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13434v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13434v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13434v1)

Prenatal ultrasound is the cornerstone for detecting congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, but diagnosis is limited by operator dependence and suboptimal imaging conditions. We sought to assess the performance of a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model for automated fetal renal anomaly classification using a curated dataset of 969 two-dimensional ultrasound images. A pretrained Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) was fine-tuned for binary and multi-class classification of normal kidneys, urinary tract dilation, and multicystic dysplastic kidney. Models were compared with a DenseNet-169 convolutional baseline using cross-validation and an independent test set. USF-MAE consistently improved upon the baseline across all evaluation metrics in both binary and multi-class settings. USF-MAE achieved an improvement of about 1.87% (AUC) and 7.8% (F1-score) on the validation set, 2.32% (AUC) and 4.33% (F1-score) on the independent holdout test set. The largest gains were observed in the multi-class setting, where the improvement in AUC was 16.28% and 46.15% in F1-score. To facilitate model interpretability, Score-CAM visualizations were adapted for a transformer architecture and show that model predictions were informed by known, clinically relevant renal structures, including the renal pelvis in urinary tract dilation and cystic regions in multicystic dysplastic kidney. These results show that ultrasound-specific self-supervised learning can generate a useful representation as a foundation for downstream diagnostic tasks. The proposed framework offers a robust, interpretable approach to support the prenatal detection of renal anomalies and demonstrates the promise of foundation models in obstetric imaging.

### A Domain-Adapted Lightweight Ensemble for Resource-Efficient Few-Shot Plant Disease Classification

Accurate and timely identification of plant leaf diseases is essential for resilient and sustainable agriculture, yet most deep learning approaches rely on large annotated datasets and computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for data-scarce and resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges we present a few-shot learning approach within a lightweight yet efficient framework that combines domain-adapted MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models as feature extractors, along with a feature fusion technique to generate robust feature representation. For the classification task, the fused features are passed through a Bi-LSTM classifier enhanced with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and focus on the most relevant features, thereby achieving optimal classification performance even in complex, real-world environments with noisy or cluttered backgrounds. The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly. Under real-world conditions using field images from the Dhan Shomadhan dataset, it maintained robust performance, reaching 69.28+-1.49% at 15-shot and demonstrating strong resilience to complex backgrounds. Notably, it also outperformed the previous SOTA accuracy of 96.0% on six diseases from PlantVillage, achieving 99.72% with only 15-shot learning. With a compact model size of approximately 40 MB and inference complexity of approximately 1.12 GFLOPs, this work establishes a scalable, mobile-ready foundation for precise plant disease diagnostics in data-scarce regions.

### MineTheGap: Automatic Mining of Biases in Text-to-Image Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13427v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13427v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13427v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13427v1)

Text-to-Image (TTI) models generate images based on text prompts, which often leave certain aspects of the desired image ambiguous. When faced with these ambiguities, TTI models have been shown to exhibit biases in their interpretations. These biases can have societal impacts, e.g., when showing only a certain race for a stated occupation. They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt. Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases. This optimization process is driven by a novel bias score, which ranks biases according to their severity, as we validate on a dataset with known biases. For a given prompt, this score is obtained by comparing the distribution of generated images to the distribution of LLM-generated texts that constitute variations on the prompt. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.

### RecTok: Reconstruction Distillation along Rectified Flow

Visual tokenizers play a crucial role in diffusion models. The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure. Furthermore, as the latent dimensionality increases, we observe consistent improvements. Code and model are available at https://shi-qingyu.github.io/rectok.github.io.

Unexploitable example generation aims to transform personal images into their unexploitable (unlearnable) versions before they are uploaded online, thereby preventing unauthorized exploitation of online personal images. Recently, this task has garnered significant research attention due to its critical relevance to personal data privacy. Yet, despite recent progress, existing methods for this task can still suffer from limited practical applicability, as they can fail to generate examples that are broadly unexploitable across different real-world computer vision tasks. To deal with this problem, in this work, we propose a novel Meta Cross-Task Unexploitable Example Generation (MCT-UEG) framework. At the core of our framework, to optimize the unexploitable example generator for effectively producing broadly unexploitable examples, we design a flat-minima-oriented meta training and testing scheme. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our framework.

### USTM: Unified Spatial and Temporal Modeling for Continuous Sign Language Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13415v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13415v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13415v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13415v1)

Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) requires precise spatio-temporal modeling to accurately recognize sequences of gestures in videos. Existing frameworks often rely on CNN-based spatial backbones combined with temporal convolution or recurrent modules. These techniques fail in capturing fine-grained hand and facial cues and modeling long-range temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal Modeling (USTM) framework, a spatio-temporal encoder that effectively models complex patterns using a combination of a Swin Transformer backbone enhanced with lightweight temporal adapter with positional embeddings (TAPE). Our framework captures fine-grained spatial features alongside short and long-term temporal context, enabling robust sign language recognition from RGB videos without relying on multi-stream inputs or auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments on benchmarked datasets including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily demonstrate that USTM achieves state-of-the-art performance against RGB-based as well as multi-modal CSLR approaches, while maintaining competitive performance against multi-stream approaches. These results highlight the strength and efficacy of the USTM framework for CSLR. The code is available at https://github.com/gufranSabri/USTM

### Computer vision training dataset generation for robotic environments using Gaussian splatting

This paper introduces a novel pipeline for generating large-scale, highly realistic, and automatically labeled datasets for computer vision tasks in robotic environments. Our approach addresses the critical challenges of the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery and the time-consuming bottleneck of manual annotation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create photorealistic representations of the operational environment and objects. These assets are then used in a game engine where physics simulations create natural arrangements. A novel, two-pass rendering technique combines the realism of splats with a shadow map generated from proxy meshes. This map is then algorithmically composited with the image to add both physically plausible shadows and subtle highlights, significantly enhancing realism. Pixel-perfect segmentation masks are generated automatically and formatted for direct use with object detection models like YOLO. Our experiments show that a hybrid training strategy, combining a small set of real images with a large volume of our synthetic data, yields the best detection and segmentation performance, confirming this as an optimal strategy for efficiently achieving robust and accurate models.

### End2Reg: Learning Task-Specific Segmentation for Markerless Registration in Spine Surgery
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13402v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13402v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13402v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13402v1)

Purpose: Intraoperative navigation in spine surgery demands millimeter-level accuracy. Current systems based on intraoperative radiographic imaging and bone-anchored markers are invasive, radiation-intensive and workflow disruptive. Recent markerless RGB-D registration methods offer a promising alternative, but existing approaches rely on weak segmentation labels to isolate relevant anatomical structures, which can propagate errors throughout registration. Methods: We present End2Reg an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly optimizes segmentation and registration, eliminating the need for weak segmentation labels and manual steps. The network learns segmentation masks specifically optimized for registration, guided solely by the registration objective without direct segmentation supervision. Results: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ex- and in-vivo benchmarks, reducing median Target Registration Error by 32% to 1.83mm and mean Root Mean Square Error by 45% to 3.95mm, respectively. An ablation study confirms that end-to-end optimization significantly improves registration accuracy. Conclusion: The presented end-to-end RGB-D registration pipeline removes dependency on weak labels and manual steps, advancing towards fully automatic, markerless intraoperative navigation.

### rNCA: Self-Repairing Segmentation Masks

Accurately predicting topologically correct masks remains a difficult task for general segmentation models, which often produce fragmented or disconnected outputs. Fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be directly re-purposed as an effective refinement mechanism, using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $β_0$ errors by 60% and $β_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively. This showcases NCA as effective and broadly applicable refiners.

### Beyond the Visible: Disocclusion-Aware Editing via Proxy Dynamic Graphs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13392v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13392v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13392v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13392v1)

We address image-to-video generation with explicit user control over the final frame's disoccluded regions. Current image-to-video pipelines produce plausible motion but struggle to generate predictable, articulated motions while enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed areas. Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables. Our method mixes generative control, in the form of loose pose and structure, with predictable controls, in the form of appearance specification in the final frame in the disoccluded regions, unlocking a new image-to-video workflow. Code will be released on acceptance. Project page: https://anranqi.github.io/beyondvisible.github.io/

### Unlocking Generalization in Polyp Segmentation with DINO Self-Attention "keys"
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13376v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13376v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13376v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13376v1)

Automatic polyp segmentation is crucial for improving the clinical identification of colorectal cancer (CRC). While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been extensively researched for this problem, current methods frequently struggle with generalization, particularly in data-constrained or challenging settings. Moreover, many existing polyp segmentation methods rely on complex, task-specific architectures. To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention "key" features for robust segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that extract tokens from the deepest layers of the Vision Transformer (ViT), our approach leverages the key features of the self-attention module with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalizability. We validate our approach using a multi-center dataset under two rigorous protocols: Domain Generalization (DG) and Extreme Single Domain Generalization (ESDG). Our results, supported by a comprehensive statistical analysis, demonstrate that this pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly enhancing generalization, particularly in data-scarce and challenging scenarios. While avoiding a polyp-specific architecture, we surpass well-established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net. Additionally, we provide a systematic benchmark of the DINO framework's evolution, quantifying the specific impact of architectural advancements on downstream polyp segmentation performance.

### Automated User Identification from Facial Thermograms with Siamese Networks

The article analyzes the use of thermal imaging technologies for biometric identification based on facial thermograms. It presents a comparative analysis of infrared spectral ranges (NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR). The paper also defines key requirements for thermal cameras used in biometric systems, including sensor resolution, thermal sensitivity, and a frame rate of at least 30 Hz. Siamese neural networks are proposed as an effective approach for automating the identification process. In experiments conducted on a proprietary dataset, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%. The study also examines the potential of hybrid systems that combine visible and infrared spectra to overcome the limitations of individual modalities. The results indicate that thermal imaging is a promising technology for developing reliable security systems.

### Face Identity Unlearning for Retrieval via Embedding Dispersion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13317v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13317v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13317v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13317v1)

Face recognition systems rely on learning highly discriminative and compact identity clusters to enable accurate retrieval. However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility.

Avatar video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, prior work exhibits limited efficiency in generating long-duration high-resolution videos, suffering from temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following as video length increases. To address these challenges, we propose KlingAvatar 2.0, a spatio-temporal cascade framework that performs upscaling in both spatial resolution and temporal dimension. The framework first generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes that capture global semantics and motion, and then refines them into high-resolution, temporally coherent sub-clips using a first-last frame strategy, while retaining smooth temporal transitions in long-form videos. To enhance cross-modal instruction fusion and alignment in extended videos, we introduce a Co-Reasoning Director composed of three modality-specific large language model (LLM) experts. These experts reason about modality priorities and infer underlying user intent, converting inputs into detailed storylines through multi-turn dialogue. A Negative Director further refines negative prompts to improve instruction alignment. Building on these components, we extend the framework to support ID-specific multi-character control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively addresses the challenges of efficient, multimodally aligned long-form high-resolution video generation, delivering enhanced visual clarity, realistic lip-teeth rendering with accurate lip synchronization, strong identity preservation, and coherent multimodal instruction following.

While existing generation and unified models excel at general image generation, they struggle with tasks requiring deep reasoning, planning, and precise data-to-visual mapping abilities beyond general scenarios. To push beyond the existing limitations, we introduce a new and challenging task: creative table visualization, requiring the model to generate an infographic that faithfully and aesthetically visualizes the data from a given table. To address this challenge, we propose ShowTable, a pipeline that synergizes MLLMs with diffusion models via a progressive self-correcting process. The MLLM acts as the central orchestrator for reasoning the visual plan and judging visual errors to provide refined instructions, the diffusion execute the commands from MLLM, achieving high-fidelity results. To support this task and our pipeline, we introduce three automated data construction pipelines for training different modules. Furthermore, we introduce TableVisBench, a new benchmark with 800 challenging instances across 5 evaluation dimensions, to assess performance on this task. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline, instantiated with different models, significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting its effective multi-modal reasoning, generation, and error correction capabilities.

### LINA: Learning INterventions Adaptively for Physical Alignment and Generalization in Diffusion Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13290v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13290v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13290v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13290v1)

Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, they still struggle with (1) physical alignment and (2) out-of-distribution (OOD) instruction following. We argue that these issues stem from the models' failure to learn causal directions and to disentangle causal factors for novel recombination. We introduce the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and the Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset to enable diagnostic interventions. This analysis yields three key insights. First, DMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning for elements not explicitly determined in the prompt. Second, the prompt embedding contains disentangled representations for texture and physics. Third, visual causal structure is disproportionately established during the initial, computationally limited denoising steps. Based on these findings, we introduce LINA (Learning INterventions Adaptively), a novel framework that learns to predict prompt-specific interventions, which employs (1) targeted guidance in the prompt and visual latent spaces, and (2) a reallocated, causality-aware denoising schedule. Our approach enforces both physical alignment and OOD instruction following in image and video DMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging causal generation tasks and the Winoground dataset.

### CausalCLIP: Causally-Informed Feature Disentanglement and Filtering for Generalizable Detection of Generated Images

The rapid advancement of generative models has increased the demand for generated image detectors capable of generalizing across diverse and evolving generation techniques. However, existing methods, including those leveraging pre-trained vision-language models, often produce highly entangled representations, mixing task-relevant forensic cues (causal features) with spurious or irrelevant patterns (non-causal features), thus limiting generalization. To address this issue, we propose CausalCLIP, a framework that explicitly disentangles causal from non-causal features and employs targeted filtering guided by causal inference principles to retain only the most transferable and discriminative forensic cues. By modeling the generation process with a structural causal model and enforcing statistical independence through Gumbel-Softmax-based feature masking and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) constraints, CausalCLIP isolates stable causal features robust to distribution shifts. When tested on unseen generative models from different series, CausalCLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability, achieving improvements of 6.83% in accuracy and 4.06% in average precision over state-of-the-art methods.

### Video Reality Test: Can AI-Generated ASMR Videos fool VLMs and Humans?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13281v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13281v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13281v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13281v1)

Recent advances in video generation have produced vivid content that are often indistinguishable from real videos, making AI-generated video detection an emerging societal challenge. Prior AIGC detection benchmarks mostly evaluate video without audio, target broad narrative domains, and focus on classification solely. Yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art video generation models can produce immersive, audio-paired videos that reliably deceive humans and VLMs. To this end, we introduce Video Reality Test, an ASMR-sourced video benchmark suite for testing perceptual realism under tight audio-visual coupling, featuring the following dimensions: \textbf{(i) Immersive ASMR video-audio sources.} Built on carefully curated real ASMR videos, the benchmark targets fine-grained action-object interactions with diversity across objects, actions, and backgrounds. \textbf{(ii) Peer-Review evaluation.} An adversarial creator-reviewer protocol where video generation models act as creators aiming to fool reviewers, while VLMs serve as reviewers seeking to identify fakeness. Our experimental findings show: The best creator Veo3.1-Fast even fools most VLMs: the strongest reviewer (Gemini 2.5-Pro) achieves only 56\% accuracy (random 50\%), far below that of human experts (81.25\%). Adding audio improves real-fake discrimination, yet superficial cues such as watermarks can still significantly mislead models. These findings delineate the current boundary of video generation realism and expose limitations of VLMs in perceptual fidelity and audio-visual consistency. Our code is available at https://github.com/video-reality-test/video-reality-test.

### CogniEdit: Dense Gradient Flow Optimization for Fine-Grained Image Editing

Instruction-based image editing with diffusion models has achieved impressive results, yet existing methods struggle with fine-grained instructions specifying precise attributes such as colors, positions, and quantities. While recent approaches employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for alignment, they optimize only at individual sampling steps, providing sparse feedback that limits trajectory-level control. We propose a unified framework CogniEdit, combining multi-modal reasoning with dense reward optimization that propagates gradients across consecutive denoising steps, enabling trajectory-level gradient flow through the sampling process. Our method comprises three components: (1) Multi-modal Large Language Models for decomposing complex instructions into actionable directives, (2) Dynamic Token Focus Relocation that adaptively emphasizes fine-grained attributes, and (3) Dense GRPO-based optimization that propagates gradients across consecutive steps for trajectory-level supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CogniEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance in balancing fine-grained instruction following with visual quality and editability preservation

### Post-Training and Test-Time Scaling of Generative Agent Behavior Models for Interactive Autonomous Driving
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13262v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13262v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13262v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13262v1)

Learning interactive motion behaviors among multiple agents is a core challenge in autonomous driving. While imitation learning models generate realistic trajectories, they often inherit biases from datasets dominated by safe demonstrations, limiting robustness in safety-critical cases. Moreover, most studies rely on open-loop evaluation, overlooking compounding errors in closed-loop execution. We address these limitations with two complementary strategies. First, we propose Group Relative Behavior Optimization (GRBO), a reinforcement learning post-training method that fine-tunes pretrained behavior models via group relative advantage maximization with human regularization. Using only 10% of the training dataset, GRBO improves safety performance by over 40% while preserving behavioral realism. Second, we introduce Warm-K, a warm-started Top-K sampling strategy that balances consistency and diversity in motion selection. Our Warm-K method-based test-time scaling enhances behavioral consistency and reactivity at test time without retraining, mitigating covariate shift and reducing performance discrepancies. Demo videos are available in the supplementary material.

### Toward Ambulatory Vision: Learning Visually-Grounded Active View Selection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13250v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13250v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13250v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13250v1)

2025/12/15 12:04 GTM

Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual question answering (VQA) but remain limited to snapshot vision, reasoning from static images. In contrast, embodied agents require ambulatory vision, actively moving to obtain more informative views. We introduce Visually Grounded Active View Selection (VG-AVS), a task that selects the most informative next viewpoint using only the visual information in the current image, without relying on scene memory or external knowledge. To support this task, we construct a synthetic dataset with automatically generated paired query-target views and question-answer prompts. We also propose a framework that fine-tunes pretrained VLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by RL-based policy optimization. Our approach achieves strong question answering performance based on viewpoint selection and generalizes robustly to unseen synthetic and real scenes. Furthermore, incorporating our learned VG-AVS framework into existing scene-exploration-based EQA systems improves downstream question-answering accuracy.

### STARCaster: Spatio-Temporal AutoRegressive Video Diffusion for Identity- and View-Aware Talking Portraits
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13247v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13247v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13247v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13247v1)

2025/12/15 11:59 GTM

This paper presents STARCaster, an identity-aware spatio-temporal video diffusion model that addresses both speech-driven portrait animation and free-viewpoint talking portrait synthesis, given an identity embedding or reference image, within a unified framework. Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.

2025/12/15 11:53 GTM

We present Ego-EXTRA, a video-language Egocentric Dataset for EXpert-TRAinee assistance. Ego-EXTRA features 50 hours of unscripted egocentric videos of subjects performing procedural activities (the trainees) while guided by real-world experts who provide guidance and answer specific questions using natural language. Following a ``Wizard of OZ'' data collection paradigm, the expert enacts a wearable intelligent assistant, looking at the activities performed by the trainee exclusively from their egocentric point of view, answering questions when asked by the trainee, or proactively interacting with suggestions during the procedures. This unique data collection protocol enables Ego-EXTRA to capture a high-quality dialogue in which expert-level feedback is provided to the trainee. Two-way dialogues between experts and trainees are recorded, transcribed, and used to create a novel benchmark comprising more than 15k high-quality Visual Question Answer sets, which we use to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models. The results show that Ego-EXTRA is challenging and highlight the limitations of current models when used to provide expert-level assistance to the user. The Ego-EXTRA dataset is publicly available to support the benchmark of egocentric video-language assistants: https://fpv-iplab.github.io/Ego-EXTRA/.

### POLAR: A Portrait OLAT Dataset and Generative Framework for Illumination-Aware Face Modeling

Face relighting aims to synthesize realistic portraits under novel illumination while preserving identity and geometry. However, progress remains constrained by the limited availability of large-scale, physically consistent illumination data. To address this, we introduce POLAR, a large-scale and physically calibrated One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) dataset containing over 200 subjects captured under 156 lighting directions, multiple views, and diverse expressions. Building upon POLAR, we develop a flow-based generative model POLARNet that predicts per-light OLAT responses from a single portrait, capturing fine-grained and direction-aware illumination effects while preserving facial identity. Unlike diffusion or background-conditioned methods that rely on statistical or contextual cues, our formulation models illumination as a continuous, physically interpretable transformation between lighting states, enabling scalable and controllable relighting. Together, POLAR and POLARNet form a unified illumination learning framework that links real data, generative synthesis, and physically grounded relighting, establishing a self-sustaining "chicken-and-egg" cycle for scalable and reproducible portrait illumination.

Collaborative perception has garnered significant attention as a crucial technology to overcome the perceptual limitations of single-agent systems. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have achieved communication efficiency and high performance via intermediate fusion. However, they share a critical vulnerability: their performance degrades under adverse communication conditions due to the misalignment induced by data transmission, which severely hampers their practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA. Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves upon its baseline performance by approximately 19% in AP@0.7 with more than 5x less communication volume, which makes it a promising solution for robust collaborative perception.

### MMDrive: Interactive Scene Understanding Beyond Vision with Multi-representational Fusion

Vision-language models enable the understanding and reasoning of complex traffic scenarios through multi-source information fusion, establishing it as a core technology for autonomous driving. However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA. MMDrive effectively breaks the traditional image-only understanding barrier, enabling robust multimodal reasoning in complex driving environments and providing a new foundation for interpretable autonomous driving scene understanding.

### Seeing the Whole Picture: Distribution-Guided Data-Free Distillation for Semantic Segmentation

Semantic segmentation requires a holistic understanding of the physical world, as it assigns semantic labels to spatially continuous and structurally coherent objects rather than to isolated pixels. However, existing data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) methods-primarily designed for classification-often disregard this continuity, resulting in significant performance degradation when applied directly to segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce DFSS, a novel data-free distillation framework tailored for semantic segmentation. Unlike prior approaches that treat pixels independently, DFSS respects the structural and contextual continuity of real-world scenes. Our key insight is to leverage Batch Normalization (BN) statistics from a teacher model to guide Approximate Distribution Sampling (ADS), enabling the selection of data that better reflects the original training distribution-without relying on potentially misleading teacher predictions. Additionally, we propose Weighted Distribution Progressive Distillation (WDPD), which dynamically prioritizes reliable samples that are more closely aligned with the original data distribution early in training and gradually incorporates more challenging cases, mirroring the natural progression of learning in human perception. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that DFSS consistently outperforms existing data-free distillation methods for semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced reliance on auxiliary data.

### A Semantically Enhanced Generative Foundation Model Improves Pathological Image Synthesis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13164v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13164v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13164v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13164v1)

The development of clinical-grade artificial intelligence in pathology is limited by the scarcity of diverse, high-quality annotated datasets. Generative models offer a potential solution but suffer from semantic instability and morphological hallucinations that compromise diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Correlation-Regulated Alignment Framework for Tissue Synthesis (CRAFTS), the first generative foundation model for pathology-specific text-to-image synthesis. By leveraging a dual-stage training strategy on approximately 2.8 million image-caption pairs, CRAFTS incorporates a novel alignment mechanism that suppresses semantic drift to ensure biological accuracy. This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering. In addition, coupling CRAFTS with ControlNet enables precise control over tissue architecture from inputs such as nuclear segmentation masks and fluorescence images. By overcoming the critical barriers of data scarcity and privacy concerns, CRAFTS provides a limitless source of diverse, annotated histology data, effectively unlocking the creation of robust diagnostic tools for rare and complex cancer phenotypes.

### Intrinsic Image Fusion for Multi-View 3D Material Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13157v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13157v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13157v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13157v1)

2025/12/15 10:05 GTM

We introduce Intrinsic Image Fusion, a method that reconstructs high-quality physically based materials from multi-view images. Material reconstruction is highly underconstrained and typically relies on analysis-by-synthesis, which requires expensive and noisy path tracing. To better constrain the optimization, we incorporate single-view priors into the reconstruction process. We leverage a diffusion-based material estimator that produces multiple, but often inconsistent, candidate decompositions per view. To reduce the inconsistency, we fit an explicit low-dimensional parametric function to the predictions. We then propose a robust optimization framework using soft per-view prediction selection together with confidence-based soft multi-view inlier set to fuse the most consistent predictions of the most confident views into a consistent parametric material space. Finally, we use inverse path tracing to optimize for the low-dimensional parameters. Our results outperform state-of-the-art methods in material disentanglement on both synthetic and real scenes, producing sharp and clean reconstructions suitable for high-quality relighting.

### StarryGazer: Leveraging Monocular Depth Estimation Models for Domain-Agnostic Single Depth Image Completion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13147v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13147v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13147v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13147v1)

The problem of depth completion involves predicting a dense depth image from a single sparse depth map and an RGB image. Unsupervised depth completion methods have been proposed for various datasets where ground truth depth data is unavailable and supervised methods cannot be applied. However, these models require auxiliary data to estimate depth values, which is far from real scenarios. Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models can produce a plausible relative depth map from a single image, but there is no work to properly combine the sparse depth map with MDE for depth completion; a simple affine transformation to the depth map will yield a high error since MDE are inaccurate at estimating depth difference between objects. We introduce StarryGazer, a domain-agnostic framework that predicts dense depth images from a single sparse depth image and an RGB image without relying on ground-truth depth by leveraging the power of large MDE models. First, we employ a pre-trained MDE model to produce relative depth images. These images are segmented and randomly rescaled to form synthetic pairs for dense pseudo-ground truth and corresponding sparse depths. A refinement network is trained with the synthetic pairs, incorporating the relative depth maps and RGB images to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. StarryGazer shows superior results over existing unsupervised methods and transformed MDE results on various datasets, demonstrating that our framework exploits the power of MDE models while appropriately fixing errors using sparse depth information.

### Weight Space Correlation Analysis: Quantifying Feature Utilization in Deep Learning Models

Deep learning models in medical imaging are susceptible to shortcut learning, relying on confounding metadata (e.g., scanner model) that is often encoded in image embeddings. The crucial question is whether the model actively utilizes this encoded information for its final prediction. We introduce Weight Space Correlation Analysis, an interpretable methodology that quantifies feature utilization by measuring the alignment between the classification heads of a primary clinical task and auxiliary metadata tasks. We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner). Our methodology provides a tool to verify model trustworthiness, demonstrating that, in the absence of induced bias, the clinical model selectively utilizes features related to the genuine clinical signal.

### Towards Unified Co-Speech Gesture Generation via Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13131v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13131v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13131v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13131v1)

Generating 3D-based body movements from speech shows great potential in extensive downstream applications, while it still suffers challenges in imitating realistic human movements. Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Code and models will be publicly available.

### LeafTrackNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Robust Leaf Tracking in Top-Down Plant Phenotyping
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13130v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13130v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13130v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13130v1)

High resolution phenotyping at the level of individual leaves offers fine-grained insights into plant development and stress responses. However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/shl-shawn/LeafTrackNet.

### DePT3R: Joint Dense Point Tracking and 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes in a Single Forward Pass
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13122v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13122v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13122v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13122v1)

Current methods for dense 3D point tracking in dynamic scenes typically rely on pairwise processing, require known camera poses, or assume a temporal ordering to input frames, constraining their flexibility and applicability. Additionally, recent advances have successfully enabled efficient 3D reconstruction from large-scale, unposed image collections, underscoring opportunities for unified approaches to dynamic scene understanding. Motivated by this, we propose DePT3R, a novel framework that simultaneously performs dense point tracking and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple images in a single forward pass. This multi-task learning is achieved by extracting deep spatio-temporal features with a powerful backbone and regressing pixel-wise maps with dense prediction heads. Crucially, DePT3R operates without requiring camera poses, substantially enhancing its adaptability and efficiency-especially important in dynamic environments with rapid changes. We validate DePT3R on several challenging benchmarks involving dynamic scenes, demonstrating strong performance and significant improvements in memory efficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods. Data and codes are available via the open repository: https://github.com/StructuresComp/DePT3R

### Diffusion-Based Restoration for Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection in Adverse Weather
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13107v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13107v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13107v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13107v1)

Multi-modal 3D object detection is important for reliable perception in robotics and autonomous driving. However, its effectiveness remains limited under adverse weather conditions due to weather-induced distortions and misalignment between different data modalities. In this work, we propose DiffFusion, a novel framework designed to enhance robustness in challenging weather through diffusion-based restoration and adaptive cross-modal fusion. Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM). It enables dynamic multi-modal fusion and bidirectional bird's-eye view (BEV) alignment to maintain consistent spatial correspondence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that DiffFusion achieves state-of-the-art robustness under adverse weather while preserving strong clean-data performance. Zero-shot results on the real-world DENSE dataset further validate its generalization. The implementation of our DiffFusion will be released as open-source.

### FID-Net: A Feature-Enhanced Deep Learning Network for Forest Infestation Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13104v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13104v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13104v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13104v1)

2025/12/15 09:01 GTM

Forest pests threaten ecosystem stability, requiring efficient monitoring. To overcome the limitations of traditional methods in large-scale, fine-grained detection, this study focuses on accurately identifying infected trees and analyzing infestation patterns. We propose FID-Net, a deep learning model that detects pest-affected trees from UAV visible-light imagery and enables infestation analysis via three spatial metrics. Based on YOLOv8n, FID-Net introduces a lightweight Feature Enhancement Module (FEM) to extract disease-sensitive cues, an Adaptive Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module (AMFM) to align and fuse dual-branch features (RGB and FEM-enhanced), and an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism to enhance discriminative information efficiently. From detection results, we construct a pest situation analysis framework using: (1) Kernel Density Estimation to locate infection hotspots; (2) neighborhood evaluation to assess healthy trees' infection risk; (3) DBSCAN clustering to identify high-density healthy clusters as priority protection zones. Experiments on UAV imagery from 32 forest plots in eastern Tianshan, China, show that FID-Net achieves 86.10% precision, 75.44% recall, 82.29% mAP@0.5, and 64.30% mAP@0.5:0.95, outperforming mainstream YOLO models. Analysis confirms infected trees exhibit clear clustering, supporting targeted forest protection. FID-Net enables accurate tree health discrimination and, combined with spatial metrics, provides reliable data for intelligent pest monitoring, early warning, and precise management.

### Harmonizing Generalization and Specialization: Uncertainty-Informed Collaborative Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13101v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13101v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13101v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13101v1)

2025/12/15 08:57 GTM

Vision foundation models have demonstrated strong generalization in medical image segmentation by leveraging large-scale, heterogeneous pretraining. However, they often struggle to generalize to specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations, due to a mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements.

### ADHint: Adaptive Hints with Difficulty Priors for Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13095v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13095v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13095v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13095v1)

2025/12/15 08:53 GTM

To combine the advantages of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), recent methods have integrated ''hints'' into post-training, which are prefix segments of complete reasoning trajectories, aiming for powerful knowledge expansion and reasoning generalization. However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

### UniVCD: A New Method for Unsupervised Change Detection in the Open-Vocabulary Era
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13089v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13089v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13089v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13089v1)

2025/12/15 08:42 GTM

Change detection (CD) identifies scene changes from multi-temporal observations and is widely used in urban development and environmental monitoring. Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD. Code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/Die-Xie/UniVCD.

### DiRe: Diversity-promoting Regularization for Dataset Condensation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13083v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13083v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13083v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13083v1)

2025/12/15 08:33 GTM

In Dataset Condensation, the goal is to synthesize a small dataset that replicates the training utility of a large original dataset. Existing condensation methods synthesize datasets with significant redundancy, so there is a dire need to reduce redundancy and improve the diversity of the synthesized datasets. To tackle this, we propose an intuitive Diversity Regularizer (DiRe) composed of cosine similarity and Euclidean distance, which can be applied off-the-shelf to various state-of-the-art condensation methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the addition of our regularizer improves state-of-the-art condensation methods on various benchmark datasets from CIFAR-10 to ImageNet-1K with respect to generalization and diversity metrics.

### Heart Disease Prediction using Case Based Reasoning (CBR)
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13078v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13078v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13078v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13078v1)

This study provides an overview of heart disease prediction using an intelligent system. Predicting disease accurately is crucial in the medical field, but traditional methods relying solely on a doctor's experience often lack precision. To address this limitation, intelligent systems are applied as an alternative to traditional approaches. While various intelligent system methods exist, this study focuses on three: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). A comparison of these techniques in terms of accuracy was conducted, and ultimately, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) was selected for heart disease prediction. In the prediction phase, the heart disease dataset underwent data pre-processing to clean the data and data splitting to separate it into training and testing sets. The chosen intelligent system was then employed to predict heart disease outcomes based on the processed data. The experiment concluded with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) achieving a notable accuracy rate of 97.95% in predicting heart disease. The findings also revealed that the probability of heart disease was 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females. Further analysis from related studies suggests that factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption are significant contributors to heart disease, particularly among males.

### Forging a Dynamic Memory: Retrieval-Guided Continual Learning for Generalist Medical Foundation Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13072v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13072v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13072v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13072v1)

Multimodal biomedical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit immense potential in the field of Continual Learning (CL). However, they confront a core dilemma: how to preserve fine-grained intra-modality features while bridging the significant domain gap across different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework. Leveraging our 18-million multimodal and comprehensive medical retrieval database derived from PubMed scientific papers, we pioneer the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into CL. Specifically, we employ a multi-modal, multi-layer RAG system that provides real-time guidance for model fine-tuning through dynamic, on-demand knowledge retrieval. Building upon this, we introduce a dynamic knowledge distillation framework. This framework precisely resolves the aforementioned core dilemma by dynamically modulating the importance of the parameter space, the granularity of the distilled knowledge, and the data distribution of the reference dataset in accordance with the required level of detail. To thoroughly validate the clinical value of our strategy, we have designed a more rigorous \textbf{M}edical Generalist Task Incremental Learning (MGTIL) benchmark. This benchmark is engineered to simultaneously evaluate the model's capacity for adaptation to significant domain shifts, retention of subtle intra-domain features, and real-time learning of novel and complex medical tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. The code is provided in the supplementary materials.

### Towards Test-time Efficient Visual Place Recognition via Asymmetric Query Processing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13055v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13055v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13055v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13055v1)

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has advanced significantly with high-capacity foundation models like DINOv2, achieving remarkable performance. Nonetheless, their substantial computational cost makes deployment on resource-constrained devices impractical. In this paper, we introduce an efficient asymmetric VPR framework that incorporates a high-capacity gallery model for offline feature extraction with a lightweight query network for online processing. A key challenge in this setting is ensuring compatibility between these heterogeneous networks, which conventional approaches address through computationally expensive k-NN-based compatible training. To overcome this, we propose a geographical memory bank that structures gallery features using geolocation metadata inherent in VPR databases, eliminating the need for exhaustive k-NN computations. Additionally, we introduce an implicit embedding augmentation technique that enhances the query network to model feature variations despite its limited capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces computational costs but also outperforms existing asymmetric retrieval techniques, establishing a new aspect for VPR in resource-limited environments. The code is available at https://github.com/jaeyoon1603/AsymVPR

### GTR-Turbo: Merged Checkpoint is Secretly a Free Teacher for Agentic VLM Training
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13043v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13043v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13043v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13043v1)

2025/12/15 07:11 GTM

Multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for multi-modal agents built upon vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by sparse rewards and long-horizon credit assignment. Recent methods densify the reward by querying a teacher that provides step-level feedback, e.g., Guided Thought Reinforcement (GTR) and On-Policy Distillation, but rely on costly, often privileged models as the teacher, limiting practicality and reproducibility. We introduce GTR-Turbo, a highly efficient upgrade to GTR, which matches the performance without training or querying an expensive teacher model. Specifically, GTR-Turbo merges the weights of checkpoints produced during the ongoing RL training, and then uses this merged model as a "free" teacher to guide the subsequent RL via supervised fine-tuning or soft logit distillation. This design removes dependence on privileged VLMs (e.g., GPT or Gemini), mitigates the "entropy collapse" observed in prior work, and keeps training stable. Across diverse visual agentic tasks, GTR-Turbo improves the accuracy of the baseline model by 10-30% while reducing wall-clock training time by 50% and compute cost by 60% relative to GTR.

### Bi-Erasing: A Bidirectional Framework for Concept Removal in Diffusion Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13039v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13039v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13039v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13039v1)

Concept erasure, which fine-tunes diffusion models to remove undesired or harmful visual concepts, has become a mainstream approach to mitigating unsafe or illegal image generation in text-to-image models.However, existing removal methods typically adopt a unidirectional erasure strategy by either suppressing the target concept or reinforcing safe alternatives, making it difficult to achieve a balanced trade-off between concept removal and generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity.

### Comprehensive Evaluation of Rule-Based, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning in Human Estimation Using Radio Wave Sensing: Accuracy, Spatial Generalization, and Output Granularity Trade-offs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13031v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13031v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13031v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13031v1)

This study presents the first comprehensive comparison of rule-based methods, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in radio wave sensing with frequency modulated continuous wave multiple input multiple output radar. We systematically evaluated five approaches in two indoor environments with distinct layouts: a rule-based connected component method; three traditional machine learning models, namely k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine; and a deep learning model combining a convolutional neural network and long short term memory. In the training environment, the convolutional neural network long short term memory model achieved the highest accuracy, while traditional machine learning models provided moderate performance. In a new layout, however, all learning based methods showed significant degradation, whereas the rule-based method remained stable. Notably, for binary detection of presence versus absence of people, all models consistently achieved high accuracy across layouts. These results demonstrate that high capacity models can produce fine grained outputs with high accuracy in the same environment, but they are vulnerable to domain shift. In contrast, rule-based methods cannot provide fine grained outputs but exhibit robustness against domain shift. Moreover, regardless of the model type, a clear trade off was revealed between spatial generalization performance and output granularity.

### Motus: A Unified Latent Action World Model

While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.

### SneakPeek: Future-Guided Instructional Streaming Video Generation

Instructional video generation is an emerging task that aims to synthesize coherent demonstrations of procedural activities from textual descriptions. Such capability has broad implications for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction, yet existing video diffusion models struggle to maintain temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps. We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions. Together, these components mitigate temporal drift, preserve motion consistency, and enable interactive video generation where future prompt updates dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions.

### Comprehensive Deployment-Oriented Assessment for Cross-Environment Generalization in Deep Learning-Based mmWave Radar Sensing

This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of spatial generalization techniques, which are essential for the practical deployment of deep learning-based radio-frequency (RF) sensing. Focusing on people counting in indoor environments using frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, we systematically investigate a broad set of approaches, including amplitude-based statistical preprocessing (sigmoid weighting and threshold zeroing), frequency-domain filtering, autoencoder-based background suppression, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning. Experimental results collected across two environments with different layouts demonstrate that sigmoid-based amplitude weighting consistently achieves superior cross-environment performance, yielding 50.1% and 55.2% reductions in root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, compared with baseline methods. Data augmentation provides additional though modest benefits, with improvements up to 8.8% in MAE. By contrast, transfer learning proves indispensable for large spatial shifts, achieving 82.1% and 91.3% reductions in RMSE and MAE, respectively, with 540 target-domain samples. Taken together, these findings establish a highly practical direction for developing radar sensing systems capable of maintaining robust accuracy under spatial variations by integrating deep learning models with amplitude-based preprocessing and efficient transfer learning.

### What Happens Next? Next Scene Prediction with a Unified Video Model

Recent unified models for joint understanding and generation have significantly advanced visual generation capabilities. However, their focus on conventional tasks like text-to-video generation has left the temporal reasoning potential of unified models largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Next Scene Prediction (NSP), a new task that pushes unified video models toward temporal and causal reasoning. Unlike text-to-video generation, NSP requires predicting plausible futures from preceding context, demanding deeper understanding and reasoning. To tackle this task, we propose a unified framework combining Qwen-VL for comprehension and LTX for synthesis, bridged by a latent query embedding and a connector module. This model is trained in three stages on our newly curated, large-scale NSP dataset: text-to-video pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning (via GRPO) with our proposed causal consistency reward. Experiments demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark, advancing the capability of generalist multimodal systems to anticipate what happens next.

### JoDiffusion: Jointly Diffusing Image with Pixel-Level Annotations for Semantic Segmentation Promotion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13014v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13014v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13014v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13014v1)

Given the inherently costly and time-intensive nature of pixel-level annotation, the generation of synthetic datasets comprising sufficiently diverse synthetic images paired with ground-truth pixel-level annotations has garnered increasing attention recently for training high-performance semantic segmentation models. However, existing methods necessitate to either predict pseudo annotations after image generation or generate images conditioned on manual annotation masks, which incurs image-annotation semantic inconsistency or scalability problem. To migrate both problems with one stone, we present a novel dataset generative diffusion framework for semantic segmentation, termed JoDiffusion. Firstly, given a standard latent diffusion model, JoDiffusion incorporates an independent annotation variational auto-encoder (VAE) network to map annotation masks into the latent space shared by images. Then, the diffusion model is tailored to capture the joint distribution of each image and its annotation mask conditioned on a text prompt. By doing these, JoDiffusion enables simultaneously generating paired images and semantically consistent annotation masks solely conditioned on text prompts, thereby demonstrating superior scalability. Additionally, a mask optimization strategy is developed to mitigate the annotation noise produced during generation. Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, and ADE20K datasets show that the annotated dataset generated by JoDiffusion yields substantial performance improvements in semantic segmentation compared to existing methods.

### TWLR: Text-Guided Weakly-Supervised Lesion Localization and Severity Regression for Explainable Diabetic Retinopathy Grading
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13008v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13008v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13008v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13008v1)

Accurate medical image analysis can greatly assist clinical diagnosis, but its effectiveness relies on high-quality expert annotations Obtaining pixel-level labels for medical images, particularly fundus images, remains costly and time-consuming. Meanwhile, despite the success of deep learning in medical imaging, the lack of interpretability limits its clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose TWLR, a two-stage framework for interpretable diabetic retinopathy (DR) assessment. In the first stage, a vision-language model integrates domain-specific ophthalmological knowledge into text embeddings to jointly perform DR grading and lesion classification, effectively linking semantic medical concepts with visual features. The second stage introduces an iterative severity regression framework based on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Lesion saliency maps generated through iterative refinement direct a progressive inpainting mechanism that systematically eliminates pathological features, effectively downgrading disease severity toward healthier fundus appearances. Critically, this severity regression approach achieves dual benefits: accurate lesion localization without pixel-level supervision and providing an interpretable visualization of disease-to-healthy transformations. Experimental results on the FGADR, DDR, and a private dataset demonstrate that TWLR achieves competitive performance in both DR classification and lesion segmentation, offering a more explainable and annotation-efficient solution for automated retinal image analysis.

### Light Field Based 6DoF Tracking of Previously Unobserved Objects
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13007v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13007v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13007v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13007v1)

Object tracking is an important step in robotics and reautonomous driving pipelines, which has to generalize to previously unseen and complex objects. Existing high-performing methods often rely on pre-captured object views to build explicit reference models, which restricts them to a fixed set of known objects. However, such reference models can struggle with visually complex appearance, reducing the quality of tracking. In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers in these difficult cases, paving the way toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.

### Few-Step Distillation for Text-to-Image Generation: A Practical Guide

Diffusion distillation has dramatically accelerated class-conditional image synthesis, but its applicability to open-ended text-to-image (T2I) generation is still unclear. We present the first systematic study that adapts and compares state-of-the-art distillation techniques on a strong T2I teacher model, FLUX.1-lite. By casting existing methods into a unified framework, we identify the key obstacles that arise when moving from discrete class labels to free-form language prompts. Beyond a thorough methodological analysis, we offer practical guidelines on input scaling, network architecture, and hyperparameters, accompanied by an open-source implementation and pretrained student models. Our findings establish a solid foundation for deploying fast, high-fidelity, and resource-efficient diffusion generators in real-world T2I applications.

### Calibrating Uncertainty for Zero-Shot Adversarial CLIP
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12997v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12997v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12997v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.12997v1)

CLIP delivers strong zero-shot classification but remains highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy.

### Tackling Snow-Induced Challenges: Safe Autonomous Lane-Keeping with Robust Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12987v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12987v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12987v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.12987v1)

This paper proposes two new algorithms for the lane keeping system (LKS) in autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating under snowy road conditions. These algorithms use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to handle uncertainties and slippage. They include Action-Robust Recurrent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-RDPG) and end-to-end Action-Robust convolutional neural network Attention Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-CADPG), two action-robust approaches for decision-making. In the AR-RDPG method, within the perception layer, camera images are first denoised using multi-scale neural networks. Then, the centerline coefficients are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). These coefficients, concatenated with the driving characteristics, are used as input to the control layer. The AR-CADPG method presents an end-to-end approach in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention mechanism are integrated within a DRL framework. Both methods are first trained in the CARLA simulator and validated under various snowy scenarios. Real-world experiments on a Jetson Nano-based autonomous vehicle confirm the feasibility and stability of the learned policies. Among the two models, the AR-CADPG approach demonstrates superior path-tracking accuracy and robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of combining temporal memory, adversarial resilience, and attention mechanisms in AVs.

### Beyond surface form: A pipeline for semantic analysis in Alzheimer's Disease detection from spontaneous speech

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that adversely affects cognitive abilities. Language-related changes can be automatically identified through the analysis of outputs from linguistic assessment tasks, such as picture description. Language models show promise as a basis for screening tools for AD, but their limited interpretability poses a challenge in distinguishing true linguistic markers of cognitive decline from surface-level textual patterns. To address this issue, we examine how surface form variation affects classification performance, with the goal of assessing the ability of language models to represent underlying semantic indicators. We introduce a novel approach where texts surface forms are transformed by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content. The transformations significantly modify the structure and lexical content, as indicated by low BLEU and chrF scores, yet retain the underlying semantics, as reflected in high semantic similarity scores, isolating the effect of semantic information, and finding models perform similarly to if they were using the original text, with only small deviations in macro-F1. We also investigate whether language from picture descriptions retains enough detail to reconstruct the original image using generative models. We found that image-based transformations add substantial noise reducing classification accuracy. Our methodology provides a novel way of looking at what features influence model predictions, and allows the removal of possible spurious correlations. We find that just using semantic information, language model based classifiers can still detect AD. This work shows that difficult to detect semantic impairment can be identified, addressing an overlooked feature of linguistic deterioration, and opening new pathways for early detection systems.

### Towards Effective Model Editing for LLM Personalization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13676v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13676v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13676v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13676v1)

Personalization is becoming indispensable for LLMs to align with individual user preferences and needs. Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries. To address these challenges, we conceptualize personalization as a model editing task and introduce Personalization Editing, a framework that applies localized edits guided by clustered preference representations. This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings.

### Towards Interactive Intelligence for Digital Humans

We introduce Interactive Intelligence, a novel paradigm of digital human that is capable of personality-aligned expression, adaptive interaction, and self-evolution. To realize this, we present Mio (Multimodal Interactive Omni-Avatar), an end-to-end framework composed of five specialized modules: Thinker, Talker, Face Animator, Body Animator, and Renderer. This unified architecture integrates cognitive reasoning with real-time multimodal embodiment to enable fluid, consistent interaction. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of interactive intelligence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated dimensions. Together, these contributions move digital humans beyond superficial imitation toward intelligent interaction.

### A stylometric analysis of speaker attribution from speech transcripts

Forensic scientists often need to identify an unknown speaker or writer in cases such as ransom calls, covert recordings, alleged suicide notes, or anonymous online communications, among many others. Speaker recognition in the speech domain usually examines phonetic or acoustic properties of a voice, and these methods can be accurate and robust under certain conditions. However, if a speaker disguises their voice or employs text-to-speech software, vocal properties may no longer be reliable, leaving only their linguistic content available for analysis. Authorship attribution methods traditionally use syntactic, semantic, and related linguistic information to identify writers of written text (authorship attribution). In this paper, we apply a content-based authorship approach to speech that has been transcribed into text, using what a speaker says to attribute speech to individuals (speaker attribution). We introduce a stylometric method, StyloSpeaker, which incorporates character, word, token, sentence, and style features from the stylometric literature on authorship, to assess whether two transcripts were produced by the same speaker. We evaluate this method on two types of transcript formatting: one approximating prescriptive written text with capitalization and punctuation and another normalized style that removes these conventions. The transcripts' conversation topics are also controlled to varying degrees. We find generally higher attribution performance on normalized transcripts, except under the strongest topic control condition, in which overall performance is highest. Finally, we compare this more explainable stylometric model to black-box neural approaches on the same data and investigate which stylistic features most effectively distinguish speakers.

### Comparative Analysis of LLM Abliteration Methods: A Cross-Architecture Evaluation

Safety alignment mechanisms in large language models prevent responses to harmful queries through learned refusal behavior, yet these same mechanisms impede legitimate research applications including cognitive modeling, adversarial testing, and security analysis. While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.

### Large-Language Memorization During the Classification of United States Supreme Court Cases
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13654v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13654v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13654v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13654v1)

Large-language models (LLMs) have been shown to respond in a variety of ways for classification tasks outside of question-answering. LLM responses are sometimes called "hallucinations" since the output is not what is ex pected. Memorization strategies in LLMs are being studied in detail, with the goal of understanding how LLMs respond. We perform a deep dive into a classification task based on United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions. The SCOTUS corpus is an ideal classification task to study for LLM memory accuracy because it presents significant challenges due to extensive sentence length, complex legal terminology, non-standard structure, and domain-specific vocabulary. Experimentation is performed with the latest LLM fine tuning and retrieval-based approaches, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, auto-modeling, and others, on two traditional category-based SCOTUS classification tasks: one with 15 labeled topics and another with 279. We show that prompt-based models with memories, such as DeepSeek, can be more robust than previous BERT-based models on both tasks scoring about 2 points better than previous models not based on prompting.

### Temporal Tokenization Strategies for Event Sequence Modeling with Large Language Models

Representing continuous time is a critical and under-explored challenge in modeling temporal event sequences with large language models (LLMs). Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities.

### Nemotron-Cascade: Scaling Cascaded Reinforcement Learning for General-Purpose Reasoning Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13607v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13607v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13607v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13607v1)

Building general-purpose reasoning models with reinforcement learning (RL) entails substantial cross-domain heterogeneity, including large variation in inference-time response lengths and verification latency. Such variability complicates the RL infrastructure, slows training, and makes training curriculum (e.g., response length extension) and hyperparameter selection challenging. In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1). Our 14B model, after RL, outperforms its SFT teacher, DeepSeek-R1-0528, on LiveCodeBench v5/v6/Pro and achieves silver-medal performance in the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We transparently share our training and data recipes.

### Textual Gradients are a Flawed Metaphor for Automatic Prompt Optimization

A well-engineered prompt can increase the performance of large language models; automatic prompt optimization techniques aim to increase performance without requiring human effort to tune the prompts. One leading class of prompt optimization techniques introduces the analogy of textual gradients. We investigate the behavior of these textual gradient methods through a series of experiments and case studies. While such methods often result in a performance improvement, our experiments suggest that the gradient analogy does not accurately explain their behavior.

### ReFusion: A Diffusion Large Language Model with Parallel Autoregressive Decoding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13586v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13586v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13586v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13586v1)

Autoregressive models (ARMs) are hindered by slow sequential inference. While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\times$ average speedup.

### Memory in the Age of AI Agents

Memory has emerged, and will continue to remain, a core capability of foundation model-based agents. As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.

### Verifying Rumors via Stance-Aware Structural Modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13559v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13559v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13559v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13559v1)

Verifying rumors on social media is critical for mitigating the spread of false information. The stances of conversation replies often provide important cues to determine a rumor's veracity. However, existing models struggle to jointly capture semantic content, stance information, and conversation strructure, especially under the sequence length constraints of transformer-based encoders. In this work, we propose a stance-aware structural modeling that encodes each post in a discourse with its stance signal and aggregates reply embedddings by stance category enabling a scalable and semantically enriched representation of the entire thread. To enhance structural awareness, we introduce stance distribution and hierarchical depth as covariates, capturing stance imbalance and the influence of reply depth. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior methods in the ability to predict truthfulness of a rumor. We also demonstrate that our model is versatile for early detection and cross-platfrom generalization.

### PrahokBART: A Pre-trained Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Khmer Natural Language Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13552v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13552v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13552v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13552v1)

This work introduces {\it PrahokBART}, a compact pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model trained from scratch for Khmer using carefully curated Khmer and English corpora. We focus on improving the pre-training corpus quality and addressing the linguistic issues of Khmer, which are ignored in existing multilingual models, by incorporating linguistic components such as word segmentation and normalization. We evaluate PrahokBART on three generative tasks: machine translation, text summarization, and headline generation, where our results demonstrate that it outperforms mBART50, a strong multilingual pre-trained model. Additionally, our analysis provides insights into the impact of each linguistic module and evaluates how effectively our model handles space during text generation, which is crucial for the naturalness of texts in Khmer.

### Fine-tuned LLM-based Code Migration Framework

The study presents the outcomes of research and experimental validation in the domain of automated codebase migration, with a focus on addressing challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems. The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.

### SkipCat: Rank-Maximized Low-Rank Compression of Large Language Models via Shared Projection and Block Skipping

Large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints.

### SIGMA: An AI-Empowered Training Stack on Early-Life Hardware

An increasing variety of AI accelerators is being considered for large-scale training. However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period. Together, these advances establish SIGMA, which not only tackles the critical challenges of large-scale training but also establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and platform innovation, offering a robust, cost-effective alternative to prevailing established accelerator stacks and significantly advancing AI capabilities and scalability. The source code of SIGMA is available at https://github.com/microsoft/LuciaTrainingPlatform.

### Advancing Bangla Machine Translation Through Informal Datasets

Bangla is the sixth most widely spoken language globally, with approximately 234 million native speakers. However, progress in open-source Bangla machine translation remains limited. Most online resources are in English and often remain untranslated into Bangla, excluding millions from accessing essential information. Existing research in Bangla translation primarily focuses on formal language, neglecting the more commonly used informal language. This is largely due to the lack of pairwise Bangla-English data and advanced translation models. If datasets and models can be enhanced to better handle natural, informal Bangla, millions of people will benefit from improved online information access. In this research, we explore current state-of-the-art models and propose improvements to Bangla translation by developing a dataset from informal sources like social media and conversational texts. This work aims to advance Bangla machine translation by focusing on informal language translation and improving accessibility for Bangla speakers in the digital world.

### neuralFOMO: Can LLMs Handle Being Second Best? Measuring Envy-Like Preferences in Multi-Agent Settings
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13481v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13481v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13481v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13481v1)

Envy is a common human behavior that shapes competitiveness and can alter outcomes in team settings. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains. These results highlight the need to consider competitive dispositions as a safety and design factor in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

### Non-Resolution Reasoning: A Framework for Preserving Semantic Ambiguity in Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13478v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13478v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13478v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13478v1)

2025/12/15 16:14 GTM

Premature semantic collapse -- the forced early commitment to a single meaning -- remains a core architectural limitation of current language models. Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing "Dr. Smith the cardiologist" from "Dr. Smith the researcher"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control.

### Scaling Laws for Code: Every Programming Language Matters
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13472v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13472v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13472v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13472v1)

Code large language models (Code LLMs) are powerful but costly to train, with scaling laws predicting performance from model size, data, and compute. However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.

### Large language models are not about language

Large Language Models are useless for linguistics, as they are probabilistic models that require a vast amount of data to analyse externalized strings of words. In contrast, human language is underpinned by a mind-internal computational system that recursively generates hierarchical thought structures. The language system grows with minimal external input and can readily distinguish between real language and impossible languages.

### Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13399v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13399v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13399v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13399v1)

The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the "meta-gradient" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention.

### Detecting Emotion Drift in Mental Health Text Using Pre-Trained Transformers
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13363v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13363v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13363v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13363v1)

This study investigates emotion drift: the change in emotional state across a single text, within mental health-related messages. While sentiment analysis typically classifies an entire message as positive, negative, or neutral, the nuanced shift of emotions over the course of a message is often overlooked. This study detects sentence-level emotions and measures emotion drift scores using pre-trained transformer models such as DistilBERT and RoBERTa. The results provide insights into patterns of emotional escalation or relief in mental health conversations. This methodology can be applied to better understand emotional dynamics in content.

### On the Effectiveness of Membership Inference in Targeted Data Extraction from Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13352v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13352v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13352v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13352v1)

2025/12/15 14:05 GTM

Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to memorizing training data, which poses serious privacy risks. Two of the most prominent concerns are training data extraction and Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). Prior research has shown that these threats are interconnected: adversaries can extract training data from an LLM by querying the model to generate a large volume of text and subsequently applying MIAs to verify whether a particular data point was included in the training set. In this study, we integrate multiple MIA techniques into the data extraction pipeline to systematically benchmark their effectiveness. We then compare their performance in this integrated setting against results from conventional MIA benchmarks, allowing us to evaluate their practical utility in real-world extraction scenarios.

### FIN-bench-v2: A Unified and Robust Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Finnish Large Language Models

2025/12/15 13:41 GTM

We introduce FIN-bench-v2, a unified benchmark suite for evaluating large language models in Finnish. FIN-bench-v2 consolidates Finnish versions of widely used benchmarks together with an updated and expanded version of the original FIN-bench into a single, consistently formatted collection, covering multiple-choice and generative tasks across reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, sentiment analysis, world knowledge, and alignment. All datasets are converted to HuggingFace Datasets, which include both cloze and multiple-choice prompt formulations with five variants per task, and we incorporate human annotation or review for machine-translated resources such as GoldenSwag and XED. To select robust tasks, we pretrain a set of 2.15B-parameter decoder-only models and use their learning curves to compute monotonicity, signal-to-noise, non-random performance, and model ordering consistency, retaining only tasks that satisfy all criteria. We further evaluate a set of larger instruction-tuned models to characterize performance across tasks and prompt formulations. All datasets, prompts, and evaluation configurations are publicly available via our fork of the Language Model Evaluation Harness at https://github.com/LumiOpen/lm-evaluation-harness. Supplementary resources are released in a separate repository at https://github.com/TurkuNLP/FIN-bench-v2.

Large language models are powerful but often limited by high computational cost, privacy concerns, and English-centric training. Recent progress demonstrates that small, efficient models with around one billion parameters can deliver strong results and enable on-device use. This paper introduces MiniLingua, a multilingual open-source LLM of one billion parameters trained from scratch for 13 European languages, designed to balance coverage and instruction-following capabilities. Based on evaluation results, the instruction-tuned version of MiniLingua outperforms EuroLLM, a model with a similar training approach but a larger training budget, on summarization, classification and both open- and closed-book question answering. Moreover, it remains competitive with more advanced state-of-the-art models on open-ended generation tasks. We release model weights, tokenizer and source code used for data processing and model training.

### Integrating Causal Reasoning into Automated Fact-Checking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13286v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13286v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13286v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13286v1)

2025/12/15 12:56 GTM

In fact-checking applications, a common reason to reject a claim is to detect the presence of erroneous cause-effect relationships between the events at play. However, current automated fact-checking methods lack dedicated causal-based reasoning, potentially missing a valuable opportunity for semantically rich explainability. To address this gap, we propose a methodology that combines event relation extraction, semantic similarity computation, and rule-based reasoning to detect logical inconsistencies between chains of events mentioned in a claim and in an evidence. Evaluated on two fact-checking datasets, this method establishes the first baseline for integrating fine-grained causal event relationships into fact-checking and enhance explainability of verdict prediction.

### AIR: Post-training Data Selection for Reasoning via Attention Head Influence
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13279v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13279v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13279v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13279v1)

LLMs achieve remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, yet effectively transferring these skills via post-training distillation remains challenging. Existing data selection methods, ranging from manual curation to heuristics based on length, entropy, or overall loss, fail to capture the causal importance of individual reasoning steps, limiting distillation efficiency. To address this, we propose Attention Influence for Reasoning (AIR), a principled, unsupervised and training-free framework that leverages mechanistic insights of the retrieval head to select high-value post-training data. AIR first identifies reasoning-critical attention heads of an off-the-shelf model, then constructs a weakened reference model with disabled head influence, and finally quantifies the resulting loss divergence as the Attention Influence Score. This score enables fine-grained assessment at both the step and sample levels, supporting step-level weighted fine-tuning and global sample selection. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that AIR consistently improves reasoning accuracy, surpassing heuristic baselines and effectively isolating the most critical steps and samples. Our work establishes a mechanism-driven, data-efficient approach for reasoning distillation in LLMs.

### AutoTool: Dynamic Tool Selection and Integration for Agentic Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13278v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13278v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13278v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13278v1)

2025/12/15 12:38 GTM

Agentic reinforcement learning has advanced large language models (LLMs) to reason through long chain-of-thought trajectories while interleaving external tool use. Existing approaches assume a fixed inventory of tools, limiting LLM agents' adaptability to new or evolving toolsets. We present AutoTool, a framework that equips LLM agents with dynamic tool-selection capabilities throughout their reasoning trajectories. We first construct a 200k dataset with explicit tool-selection rationales across 1,000+ tools and 100+ tasks spanning mathematics, science, code generation, and multimodal reasoning. Building on this data foundation, AutoTool employs a dual-phase optimization pipeline: (i) supervised and RL-based trajectory stabilization for coherent reasoning, and (ii) KL-regularized Plackett-Luce ranking to refine consistent multi-step tool selection. Across ten diverse benchmarks, we train two base models, Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, with AutoTool. With fewer parameters, AutoTool consistently outperforms advanced LLM agents and tool-integration methods, yielding average gains of 6.4% in math & science reasoning, 4.5% in search-based QA, 7.7% in code generation, and 6.9% in multimodal understanding. In addition, AutoTool exhibits stronger generalization by dynamically leveraging unseen tools from evolving toolsets during inference.

### Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling for Accelerating Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13194v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13194v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13194v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13194v1)

2025/12/15 11:08 GTM

Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant "random rejection" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \(1 - \max(P_{\mathrm{target}})\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.

Effective human-agent collaboration is increasingly prevalent in real-world applications. Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions.

### MAC: A Multi-Agent Framework for Interactive User Clarification in Multi-turn Conversations

Conversational agents often encounter ambiguous user requests, requiring an effective clarification to successfully complete tasks. While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition. Our findings highlight the importance of active user interaction and role-aware clarification for more reliable human-agent communication.

### Uncovering the Role of Initial Saliency in U-Shaped Attention Bias: Scaling Initial Token Weight for Enhanced Long-Text Processing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13109v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13109v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13109v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13109v1)

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\% in KV-Retrieval tasks.

### Heart Disease Prediction using Case Based Reasoning (CBR)

This study provides an overview of heart disease prediction using an intelligent system. Predicting disease accurately is crucial in the medical field, but traditional methods relying solely on a doctor's experience often lack precision. To address this limitation, intelligent systems are applied as an alternative to traditional approaches. While various intelligent system methods exist, this study focuses on three: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). A comparison of these techniques in terms of accuracy was conducted, and ultimately, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) was selected for heart disease prediction. In the prediction phase, the heart disease dataset underwent data pre-processing to clean the data and data splitting to separate it into training and testing sets. The chosen intelligent system was then employed to predict heart disease outcomes based on the processed data. The experiment concluded with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) achieving a notable accuracy rate of 97.95% in predicting heart disease. The findings also revealed that the probability of heart disease was 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females. Further analysis from related studies suggests that factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption are significant contributors to heart disease, particularly among males.

### M-GRPO: Stabilizing Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models with Momentum-Anchored Policy Optimization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13070v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13070v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13070v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13070v1)

Self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL) presents a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without reliance on expensive human-annotated data. However, we find that existing methods suffer from a critical failure mode under long-horizon training: a "policy collapse" where performance precipitously degrades. We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance.

### LLM Rationalis? Measuring Bargaining Capabilities of AI Negotiators
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13063v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13063v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13063v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13063v1)

Bilateral negotiation is a complex, context-sensitive task in which human negotiators dynamically adjust anchors, pacing, and flexibility to exploit power asymmetries and informal cues. We introduce a unified mathematical framework for modeling concession dynamics based on a hyperbolic tangent curve, and propose two metrics burstiness tau and the Concession-Rigidity Index (CRI) to quantify the timing and rigidity of offer trajectories. We conduct a large-scale empirical comparison between human negotiators and four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across natural-language and numeric-offers settings, with and without rich market context, as well as six controlled power-asymmetry scenarios. Our results reveal that, unlike humans who smoothly adapt to situations and infer the opponents position and strategies, LLMs systematically anchor at extremes of the possible agreement zone for negotiations and optimize for fixed points irrespective of leverage or context. Qualitative analysis further shows limited strategy diversity and occasional deceptive tactics used by LLMs. Moreover the ability of LLMs to negotiate does not improve with better models. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current LLM negotiation capabilities and point to the need for models that better internalize opponent reasoning and context-dependent strategy.

### An Open and Reproducible Deep Research Agent for Long-Form Question Answering

We present an open deep research system for long-form question answering, selected as a winning system in the text-to-text track of the MMU-RAG competition at NeurIPS 2025. The system combines an open-source large language model (LLM) with an open web search API to perform iterative retrieval, reasoning, and synthesis in real-world open-domain settings. To enhance reasoning quality, we apply preference tuning based on LLM-as-a-judge feedback that evaluates multiple aspects, including clarity, insightfulness, and factuality. Our experimental results show that the proposed method consistently improves answer quality across all three aspects. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/efficient-deep-research/efficient-deep-research.

### Understanding Structured Financial Data with LLMs: A Case Study on Fraud Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13040v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13040v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13040v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13040v1)

Detecting fraud in financial transactions typically relies on tabular models that demand heavy feature engineering to handle high-dimensional data and offer limited interpretability, making it difficult for humans to understand predictions. Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis.

### Scaling Bidirectional Spans and Span Violations in Attention Mechanism

The canonical $O(N^2)$ Transformer remains the empirical performance frontier in sequence modeling, and its training can be further optimized by addressing geometric inefficiency. We propose an optimization framework that leverages an asymmetric projection to decompose the backward-pass gradients into parallel spans and orthogonal violations, while keeping the canonical forward-pass $QKV$ structure intact. Through consistent experimental validation across various decomposition and projection setups, we provide strong theoretical evidence: the standard attention gradient is suboptimal. We demonstrated that selectively scaling these components, focusing primarily on $0^{th}$ order bidirectional parallel spans, yields the most effective learning signal. On the limited WikiText-2 dataset, and using a crude configuration, this method achieved a $0.56\%$ reduction in validation loss, confirming the framework's fundamental validity and suggesting significant potential gains on larger datasets and deeper training regimes

### NL2SpaTiaL: Generating Geometric Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications from Natural Language for Manipulation Tasks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13670v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13670v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13670v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13670v1)

2025/12/15 18:56 GTM

Spatio-Temporal Logic (SpaTiaL) offers a principled formalism for expressing geometric spatial requirements-an essential component of robotic manipulation, where object locations, neighborhood relations, pose constraints, and interactions directly determine task success. Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

### RoboTracer: Mastering Spatial Trace with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13660v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13660v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13660v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13660v1)

Spatial tracing, as a fundamental embodied interaction ability for robots, is inherently challenging as it requires multi-step metric-grounded reasoning compounded with complex spatial referring and real-world metric measurement. However, existing methods struggle with this compositional task. To this end, we propose RoboTracer, a 3D-aware VLM that first achieves both 3D spatial referring and measuring via a universal spatial encoder and a regression-supervised decoder to enhance scale awareness during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboTracer advances multi-step metric-grounded reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with metric-sensitive process rewards, supervising key intermediate perceptual cues to accurately generate spatial traces. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce TraceSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, spanning outdoor/indoor/tabletop scenes and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 9 steps). We further present TraceSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap to evaluate spatial tracing. Experimental results show that RoboTracer surpasses baselines in spatial understanding, measuring, and referring, with an average success rate of 79.1%, and also achieves SOTA performance on TraceSpatial-Bench by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 36% accuracy. Notably, RoboTracer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

### World Models Can Leverage Human Videos for Dexterous Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13644v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13644v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13644v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13644v1)

Dexterous manipulation is challenging because it requires understanding how subtle hand motion influences the environment through contact with objects. We introduce DexWM, a Dexterous Manipulation World Model that predicts the next latent state of the environment conditioned on past states and dexterous actions. To overcome the scarcity of dexterous manipulation datasets, DexWM is trained on over 900 hours of human and non-dexterous robot videos. To enable fine-grained dexterity, we find that predicting visual features alone is insufficient; therefore, we introduce an auxiliary hand consistency loss that enforces accurate hand configurations. DexWM outperforms prior world models conditioned on text, navigation, and full-body actions, achieving more accurate predictions of future states. DexWM also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen manipulation skills when deployed on a Franka Panda arm equipped with an Allegro gripper, outperforming Diffusion Policy by over 50% on average in grasping, placing, and reaching tasks.

### MindDrive: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Autonomous Driving via Online Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13636v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13636v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13636v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13636v1)

2025/12/15 18:31 GTM

Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.

### Near-Field Perception for Safety Enhancement of Autonomous Mobile Robots in Manufacturing Environments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13561v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13561v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13561v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13561v1)

Near-field perception is essential for the safe operation of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in manufacturing environments. Conventional ranging sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ultrasonic devices provide broad situational awareness but often fail to detect small objects near the robot base. To address this limitation, this paper presents a three-tier near-field perception framework. The first approach employs light-discontinuity detection, which projects a laser stripe across the near-field zone and identifies interruptions in the stripe to perform fast, binary cutoff sensing for obstacle presence. The second approach utilizes light-displacement measurement to estimate object height by analyzing the geometric displacement of a projected stripe in the camera image, which provides quantitative obstacle height information with minimal computational overhead. The third approach employs a computer vision-based object detection model on embedded AI hardware to classify objects, enabling semantic perception and context-aware safety decisions. All methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 system, achieving real-time performance at 25 or 50 frames per second. Experimental evaluation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy balances precision, computation, and cost, thereby providing a scalable perception solution for enabling safe operations of AMRs in manufacturing environments.

### Reinforcement Learning based 6-DoF Maneuvers for Microgravity Intravehicular Docking: A Simulation Study with Int-Ball2 in ISS-JEM

Autonomous free-flyers play a critical role in intravehicular tasks aboard the International Space Station (ISS), where their precise docking under sensing noise, small actuation mismatches, and environmental variability remains a nontrivial challenge. This work presents a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) docking of JAXA's Int-Ball2 robot inside a high-fidelity Isaac Sim model of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we train and evaluate controllers under domain-randomized dynamics and bounded observation noise, while explicitly modeling propeller drag-torque effects and polarity structure. This enables a controlled study of how Int-Ball2's propulsion physics influence RL-based docking performance in constrained microgravity interiors. The learned policy achieves stable and reliable docking across varied conditions and lays the groundwork for future extensions pertaining to Int-Ball2 in collision-aware navigation, safe RL, propulsion-accurate sim-to-real transfer, and vision-based end-to-end docking.

### Evaluating the Navigation Capabilities of a Modified COAST Guidewire Robot in an Anatomical Phantom Model

To address the issues that arise due to the manual navigation of guidewires in endovascular interventions, research in medical robotics has taken a strong interest in developing robotically steerable guidewires, which offer the possibility of enhanced maneuverability and navigation, as the tip of the guidewire can be actively steered. The COaxially Aligned STeerable (COAST) guidewire robot has the ability to generate a wide variety of motions including bending motion with different bending lengths, follow-the-leader motion, and feedforward motion. In our past studies, we have explored different designs of the COAST guidewire robot and developed modeling, control, and sensing strategies for the COAST guidewire robot. In this study, the performance of a modified COAST guidewire robot is evaluated by conducting navigation experiments in an anatomical phantom model with pulsatile flow. The modified COAST guidewire robot is a simplified version of the COAST guidewire robot and consists of two tubes as opposed to three tubes. Through this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified COAST guidewire robot in navigating the tortuous phantom vasculature.

### Universal Dexterous Functional Grasping via Demonstration-Editing Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved great success in dexterous grasping, significantly improving grasp performance and generalization from simulation to the real world. However, fine-grained functional grasping, which is essential for downstream manipulation tasks, remains underexplored and faces several challenges: the complexity of specifying goals and reward functions for functional grasps across diverse objects, the difficulty of multi-task RL exploration, and the challenge of sim-to-real transfer. In this work, we propose DemoFunGrasp for universal dexterous functional grasping. We factorize functional grasping conditions into two complementary components - grasping style and affordance - and integrate them into an RL framework that can learn to grasp any object with any functional grasping condition. To address the multi-task optimization challenge, we leverage a single grasping demonstration and reformulate the RL problem as one-step demonstration editing, substantially enhancing sample efficiency and performance. Experimental results in both simulation and the real world show that DemoFunGrasp generalizes to unseen combinations of objects, affordances, and grasping styles, outperforming baselines in both success rate and functional grasping accuracy. In addition to strong sim-to-real capability, by incorporating a vision-language model (VLM) for planning, our system achieves autonomous instruction-following grasp execution.

### Fast Policy Learning for 6-DOF Position Control of Underwater Vehicles

Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) require reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) position control to operate effectively in complex and dynamic marine environments. Traditional controllers are effective under nominal conditions but exhibit degraded performance when faced with unmodeled dynamics or environmental disturbances. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful alternative but training is typically slow and sim-to-real transfer remains challenging. This work introduces a GPU-accelerated RL training pipeline built in JAX and MuJoCo-XLA (MJX). By jointly JIT-compiling large-scale parallel physics simulation and learning updates, we achieve training times of under two minutes.Through systematic evaluation of multiple RL algorithms, we show robust 6-DOF trajectory tracking and effective disturbance rejection in real underwater experiments, with policies transferred zero-shot from simulation. Our results provide the first explicit real-world demonstration of RL-based AUV position control across all six degrees of freedom.

### Control of a Twin Rotor using Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for controlling and stabilizing the Twin Rotor Aerodynamic System (TRAS) at specific pitch and azimuth angles and tracking a given trajectory. The complex dynamics and non-linear characteristics of the TRAS make it challenging to control using traditional control algorithms. However, recent developments in RL have attracted interest due to their potential applications in the control of multirotors. The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm was used in this paper to train the RL agent. This algorithm is used for environments with continuous state and action spaces, similar to the TRAS, as it does not require a model of the system. The simulation results illustrated the effectiveness of the RL control method. Next, external disturbances in the form of wind disturbances were used to test the controller's effectiveness compared to conventional PID controllers. Lastly, experiments on a laboratory setup were carried out to confirm the controller's effectiveness in real-world applications.

### Humanoid Robot Running Through Random Stepping Stones and Jumping Over Obstacles: Step Adaptation Using Spring-Mass Trajectories
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13304v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13304v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13304v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13304v1)

This study proposes a step adaptation framework for running through spring-mass trajectories and deadbeat control gain libraries. It includes four main parts: (1) Automatic spring-mass trajectory library generation; (2) Deadbeat control gain library generation through an actively controlled template model that resembles the whole-body dynamics well; (3) Trajectory selection policy development for step adaptation; (4) Mapping spring-mass trajectories to a humanoid model through a whole-body control (WBC) framework also accounting for closed-kinematic chain systems, self collisions, and reactive limb swinging. We show the inclusiveness and the robustness of the proposed framework through various challenging and agile behaviors such as running through randomly generated stepping stones, jumping over random obstacles, performing slalom motions, changing the running direction suddenly with a random leg, and rejecting significant disturbances and uncertainties through the MuJoCo physics simulator. We also perform additional simulations under a comprehensive set of uncertainties and noise to better justify the proposed method's robustness to real-world challenges, including signal noise, imprecision, modeling errors, and delays. All the aforementioned behaviors are performed with a single library and the same set of WBC control parameters without additional tuning. The spring-mass and the deadbeat control gain library are automatically computed in 4.5 seconds in total for 315 different trajectories.

### Intrinsic-Motivation Multi-Robot Social Formation Navigation with Coordinated Exploration
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13293v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13293v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13293v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13293v1)

This paper investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to multi-robot social formation navigation, a critical capability for enabling seamless human-robot coexistence. While RL offers a promising paradigm, the inherent unpredictability and often uncooperative dynamics of pedestrian behavior pose substantial challenges, particularly concerning the efficiency of coordinated exploration among robots. To address this, we propose a novel coordinated-exploration multi-robot RL algorithm introducing an intrinsic motivation exploration. Its core component is a self-learning intrinsic reward mechanism designed to collectively alleviate policy conservatism. Moreover, this algorithm incorporates a dual-sampling mode within the centralized training and decentralized execution framework to enhance the representation of both the navigation policy and the intrinsic reward, leveraging a two-time-scale update rule to decouple parameter updates. Empirical results on social formation navigation benchmarks demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across crucial metrics.

### Lightweight Dynamic Modeling of Cable-Driven Continuum Robots Based on Actuation-Space Energy Formulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13271v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13271v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13271v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13271v1)

Cable-driven continuum robots (CDCRs) require accurate, real-time dynamic models for high-speed dynamics prediction or model-based control, making such capability an urgent need. In this paper, we propose the Lightweight Actuation-Space Energy Modeling (LASEM) framework for CDCRs, which formulates actuation potential energy directly in actuation space to enable lightweight yet accurate dynamic modeling. Through a unified variational derivation, the governing dynamics reduce to a single partial differential equation (PDE), requiring only the Euler moment balance while implicitly incorporating the Newton force balance. By also avoiding explicit computation of cable-backbone contact forces, the formulation simplifies the model structure and improves computational efficiency while preserving geometric accuracy and physical consistency. Importantly, the proposed framework for dynamic modeling natively supports both force-input and displacement-input actuation modes, a capability seldom achieved in existing dynamic formulations. Leveraging this lightweight structure, a Galerkin space-time modal discretization with analytical time-domain derivatives of the reduced state further enables an average 62.3% computational speedup over state-of-the-art real-time dynamic modeling approaches.

### Post-Training and Test-Time Scaling of Generative Agent Behavior Models for Interactive Autonomous Driving

Learning interactive motion behaviors among multiple agents is a core challenge in autonomous driving. While imitation learning models generate realistic trajectories, they often inherit biases from datasets dominated by safe demonstrations, limiting robustness in safety-critical cases. Moreover, most studies rely on open-loop evaluation, overlooking compounding errors in closed-loop execution. We address these limitations with two complementary strategies. First, we propose Group Relative Behavior Optimization (GRBO), a reinforcement learning post-training method that fine-tunes pretrained behavior models via group relative advantage maximization with human regularization. Using only 10% of the training dataset, GRBO improves safety performance by over 40% while preserving behavioral realism. Second, we introduce Warm-K, a warm-started Top-K sampling strategy that balances consistency and diversity in motion selection. Our Warm-K method-based test-time scaling enhances behavioral consistency and reactivity at test time without retraining, mitigating covariate shift and reducing performance discrepancies. Demo videos are available in the supplementary material.

### A Unified Framework for Automated Assembly Sequence and Production Line Planning using Graph-based Optimization

This paper presents PyCAALP (Python-based Computer-Aided Assembly Line Planning), a framework for automated Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP) and Production Line Planning (PLP), employing a graph-based approach to model components and joints within production modules. The framework integrates kinematic boundary conditions, such as potential part collisions, to guarantee the feasibility of automated assembly planning. The developed algorithm computes all feasible production sequences, integrating modules for detecting spatial relationships and formulating geometric constraints. The algorithm incorporates additional attributes, including handling feasibility, tolerance matching, and joint compatibility, to manage the high combinatorial complexity inherent in assembly sequence generation. Heuristics, such as Single-Piece Flow assembly and geometrical constraint enforcement, are utilized to further refine the solution space, facilitating more efficient planning for complex assemblies. The PLP stage is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), balancing the total times of a fixed number of manufacturing stations. While some complexity reduction techniques may sacrifice optimality, they significantly reduce the MIPs computational time. Furthermore, the framework enables customization of engineering constraints and supports a flexible trade-off between ASP and PLP. The open-source nature of the framework, available at https://github.com/TUM-utg/PyCAALP, promotes further collaboration and adoption in both industrial and production research applications.

### Multi-directional Safe Rectangle Corridor-Based MPC for Nonholonomic Robots Navigation in Cluttered Environment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13215v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13215v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13215v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13215v1)

Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) have become indispensable in industrial applications due to their operational flexibility and efficiency. Navigation serves as a crucial technical foundation for accomplishing complex tasks. However, navigating AMRs in dense, cluttered, and semi-structured environments remains challenging, primarily due to nonholonomic vehicle dynamics, interactions with mixed static/dynamic obstacles, and the non-convex constrained nature of such operational spaces. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an Improved Sequential Model Predictive Control (ISMPC) navigation framework that systematically reformulates navigation tasks as sequential switched optimal control problems. The framework addresses the aforementioned challenges through two key innovations: 1) Implementation of a Multi-Directional Safety Rectangular Corridor (MDSRC) algorithm, which encodes the free space through rectangular convex regions to avoid collision with static obstacles, eliminating redundant computational burdens and accelerating solver convergence; 2) A sequential MPC navigation framework that integrates corridor constraints with barrier function constraints is proposed to achieve static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The ISMPC navigation framework enables direct velocity generation for AMRs, simplifying traditional navigation algorithm architectures. Comparative experiments demonstrate the framework's superiority in free-space utilization ( an increase of 41.05$\%$ in the average corridor area) while maintaining real-time computational performance (average corridors generation latency of 3 ms).

### Differentiable Material Point Method for the Control of Deformable Objects

Controlling the deformation of flexible objects is challenging due to their non-linear dynamics and high-dimensional configuration space. This work presents a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) simulator targeted at control applications. We exploit the differentiability of the simulator to optimize a control trajectory in an active damping problem for a hyperelastic rope. The simulator effectively minimizes the kinetic energy of the rope around 2$\times$ faster than a baseline MPPI method and to a 20% lower energy level, while using about 3% of the computation time.

### ALBATROSS: A robotised system for high-throughput electrolyte screening via automated electrolyte formulation, coin-cell fabrication, and electrochemical evaluation

As battery technologies advance toward higher stability and energy density, the need for extensive cell-level testing across various component configurations becomes critical. To evaluate performance and understand the operating principles of batteries in laboratory scale, fabrication and evaluation of coin cells are essential processes. However, the conventional coin-cell assembly and testing processes require significant time and labor from researchers, posing challenges to high-throughput screening research. In this study, we introduce an Automated Li-ion BAttery Testing RObot SyStem (ALBATROSS), an automated system capable of electrolyte formulation, coin-cell assembly, and electrochemical evaluation. The system, integrated within a argon-filled glovebox, enables fully automated assembly and testing of up to 48 cells without researcher intervention. By incorporating custom-designed robot gripper and 3D-printed structures optimized for precise cell handling, ALBATROSS achieved high assembly reliability, yielding a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 1.2% in discharge capacity and a standard deviation of less than 3 Ω in EIS measurements for NCM811||Li half cells. Owing to its high reliability and automation capability, ALBATROSS allows for the acquisition of high-quality coin-cell datasets, which are expected to accelerate the development of next-generation electrolytes.

### Efficient Generation of Smooth Paths with Curvature Guarantees by Mollification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13183v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13183v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13183v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13183v1)

Most path following and trajectory tracking algorithms in mobile robotics require the desired path or trajectory to be defined by at least twice continuously differentiable functions to guarantee key properties such as global convergence, especially for nonholonomic robots like unicycles with speed constraints. Consequently, these algorithms typically exclude continuous but non-differentiable paths, such as piecewise functions. Despite this exclusion, such paths provide convenient high-level inputs for describing robot missions or behavior. While techniques such as spline interpolation or optimization-based methods are commonly used to smooth non-differentiable paths or create feasible ones from sequences of waypoints, they either can produce unnecessarily complex trajectories or are computationally expensive. In this work, we present a method to regularize non-differentiable functions and generate feasible paths through mollification. Specifically, we approximate an arbitrary path with a differentiable function that can converge to it with arbitrary precision. Additionally, we provide a systematic method for bounding the curvature of generated paths, which we demonstrate by applying it to paths resulting from linking a sequence of waypoints with segments. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, enabling real-time implementation on microcontrollers and compatibility with standard trajectory tracking and path following algorithms.

### MMDrive: Interactive Scene Understanding Beyond Vision with Multi-representational Fusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13177v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13177v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13177v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13177v1)

Vision-language models enable the understanding and reasoning of complex traffic scenarios through multi-source information fusion, establishing it as a core technology for autonomous driving. However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA. MMDrive effectively breaks the traditional image-only understanding barrier, enabling robust multimodal reasoning in complex driving environments and providing a new foundation for interpretable autonomous driving scene understanding.

### Iterative Tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robotic Manufacturing Tasks

Manufacturing processes are often perturbed by drifts in the environment and wear in the system, requiring control re-tuning even in the presence of repetitive operations. This paper presents an iterative learning framework for automatic tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) weighting matrices based on task-level performance feedback. Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm. The method offers a practical solution for adaptive NMPC tuning in repetitive robotic tasks, combining the precision of carefully optimized controllers with the flexibility of online adaptation.

### START: Traversing Sparse Footholds with Terrain Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13153v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13153v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13153v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13153v1)

Traversing terrains with sparse footholds like legged animals presents a promising yet challenging task for quadruped robots, as it requires precise environmental perception and agile control to secure safe foot placement while maintaining dynamic stability. Model-based hierarchical controllers excel in laboratory settings, but suffer from limited generalization and overly conservative behaviors. End-to-end learning-based approaches unlock greater flexibility and adaptability, but existing state-of-the-art methods either rely on heightmaps that introduce noise and complex, costly pipelines, or implicitly infer terrain features from egocentric depth images, often missing accurate critical geometric cues and leading to inefficient learning and rigid gaits. To overcome these limitations, we propose START, a single-stage learning framework that enables agile, stable locomotion on highly sparse and randomized footholds. START leverages only low-cost onboard vision and proprioception to accurately reconstruct local terrain heightmap, providing an explicit intermediate representation to convey essential features relevant to sparse foothold regions. This supports comprehensive environmental understanding and precise terrain assessment, reducing exploration cost and accelerating skill acquisition. Experimental results demonstrate that START achieves zero-shot transfer across diverse real-world scenarios, showcasing superior adaptability, precise foothold placement, and robust locomotion.

### OXE-AugE: A Large-Scale Robot Augmentation of OXE for Scaling Cross-Embodiment Policy Learning

Large and diverse datasets are needed for training generalist robot policies that have potential to control a variety of robot embodiments -- robot arm and gripper combinations -- across diverse tasks and environments. As re-collecting demonstrations and retraining for each new hardware platform are prohibitively costly, we show that existing robot data can be augmented for transfer and generalization. The Open X-Embodiment (OXE) dataset, which aggregates demonstrations from over 60 robot datasets, has been widely used as the foundation for training generalist policies. However, it is highly imbalanced: the top four robot types account for over 85\% of its real data, which risks overfitting to robot-scene combinations. We present AugE-Toolkit, a scalable robot augmentation pipeline, and OXE-AugE, a high-quality open-source dataset that augments OXE with 9 different robot embodiments. OXE-AugE provides over 4.4 million trajectories, more than triple the size of the original OXE. We conduct a systematic study of how scaling robot augmentation impacts cross-embodiment learning. Results suggest that augmenting datasets with diverse arms and grippers improves policy performance not only on the augmented robots, but also on unseen robots and even the original robots under distribution shifts. In physical experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art generalist policies such as OpenVLA and $π_0$ benefit from fine-tuning on OXE-AugE, improving success rates by 24-45% on previously unseen robot-gripper combinations across four real-world manipulation tasks.

### Sequence of Expert: Boosting Imitation Planners for Autonomous Driving through Temporal Alternation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13094v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13094v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13094v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13094v1)

Imitation learning (IL) has emerged as a central paradigm in autonomous driving. While IL excels in matching expert behavior in open-loop settings by minimizing per-step prediction errors, its performance degrades unexpectedly in closed-loop due to the gradual accumulation of small, often imperceptible errors over time.Over successive planning cycles, these errors compound, potentially resulting in severe failures.Current research efforts predominantly rely on increasingly sophisticated network architectures or high-fidelity training datasets to enhance the robustness of IL planners against error accumulation, focusing on the state-level robustness at a single time point. However, autonomous driving is inherently a continuous-time process, and leveraging the temporal scale to enhance robustness may provide a new perspective for addressing this issue.To this end, we propose a method termed Sequence of Experts (SoE), a temporal alternation policy that enhances closed-loop performance without increasing model size or data requirements. Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models.

### PvP: Data-Efficient Humanoid Robot Learning with Proprioceptive-Privileged Contrastive Representations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13093v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13093v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13093v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13093v1)

Achieving efficient and robust whole-body control (WBC) is essential for enabling humanoid robots to perform complex tasks in dynamic environments. Despite the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in this domain, its sample inefficiency remains a significant challenge due to the intricate dynamics and partial observability of humanoid robots. To address this limitation, we propose PvP, a Proprioceptive-Privileged contrastive learning framework that leverages the intrinsic complementarity between proprioceptive and privileged states. PvP learns compact and task-relevant latent representations without requiring hand-crafted data augmentations, enabling faster and more stable policy learning. To support systematic evaluation, we develop SRL4Humanoid, the first unified and modular framework that provides high-quality implementations of representative state representation learning (SRL) methods for humanoid robot learning. Extensive experiments on the LimX Oli robot across velocity tracking and motion imitation tasks demonstrate that PvP significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance compared to baseline SRL methods. Our study further provides practical insights into integrating SRL with RL for humanoid WBC, offering valuable guidance for data-efficient humanoid robot learning.

### Multi-Robot Motion Planning from Vision and Language using Heat-Inspired Diffusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13090v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13090v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13090v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13090v1)

2025/12/15 08:43 GTM

Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for robot motion planning by capturing the multi-modal distribution of feasible trajectories. However, their extension to multi-robot settings with flexible, language-conditioned task specifications remains limited. Furthermore, current diffusion-based approaches incur high computational cost during inference and struggle with generalization because they require explicit construction of environment representations and lack mechanisms for reasoning about geometric reachability. To address these limitations, we present Language-Conditioned Heat-Inspired Diffusion (LCHD), an end-to-end vision-based framework that generates language-conditioned, collision-free trajectories. LCHD integrates CLIP-based semantic priors with a collision-avoiding diffusion kernel serving as a physical inductive bias that enables the planner to interpret language commands strictly within the reachable workspace. This naturally handles out-of-distribution scenarios -- in terms of reachability -- by guiding robots toward accessible alternatives that match the semantic intent, while eliminating the need for explicit obstacle information at inference time. Extensive evaluations on diverse real-world-inspired maps, along with real-robot experiments, show that LCHD consistently outperforms prior diffusion-based planners in success rate, while reducing planning latency.

### Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining through Visual-Physical Alignment from Human Videos
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13080v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13080v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13080v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13080v1)

2025/12/15 08:31 GTM

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models provide a promising paradigm for robot learning by integrating visual perception with language-guided policy learning. However, most existing approaches rely on 2D visual inputs to perform actions in 3D physical environments, creating a significant gap between perception and action grounding. To bridge this gap, we propose a Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining paradigm that performs explicit alignment between visual space and physical space during pretraining, enabling models to acquire 3D spatial understanding before robot policy learning. Starting from pretrained vision-language models, we leverage large-scale human demonstration videos to extract 3D visual and 3D action annotations, forming a new source of supervision that aligns 2D visual observations with 3D spatial reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with VIPA-VLA, a dual-encoder architecture that incorporates a 3D visual encoder to augment semantic visual representations with 3D-aware features. When adapted to downstream robot tasks, VIPA-VLA achieves significantly improved grounding between 2D vision and 3D action, resulting in more robust and generalizable robotic policies.

### Motus: A Unified Latent Action World Model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13030v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13030v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13030v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13030v1)

While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.

### K-VARK: Kernelized Variance-Aware Residual Kalman Filter for Sensorless Force Estimation in Collaborative Robots
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13009v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13009v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13009v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.13009v1)

2025/12/15 06:11 GTM

Reliable estimation of contact forces is crucial for ensuring safe and precise interaction of robots with unstructured environments. However, accurate sensorless force estimation remains challenging due to inherent modeling errors and complex residual dynamics and friction. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose K-VARK (Kernelized Variance-Aware Residual Kalman filter), a novel approach that integrates a kernelized, probabilistic model of joint residual torques into an adaptive Kalman filter framework. Through Kernelized Movement Primitives trained on optimized excitation trajectories, K-VARK captures both the predictive mean and input-dependent heteroscedastic variance of residual torques, reflecting data variability and distance-to-training effects. These statistics inform a variance-aware virtual measurement update by augmenting the measurement noise covariance, while the process noise covariance adapts online via variational Bayesian optimization to handle dynamic disturbances. Experimental validation on a 6-DoF collaborative manipulator demonstrates that K-VARK achieves over 20% reduction in RMSE compared to state-of-the-art sensorless force estimation methods, yielding robust and accurate external force/torque estimation suitable for advanced tasks such as polishing and assembly.

### Learning Terrain Aware Bipedal Locomotion via Reduced Dimensional Perceptual Representations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12993v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12993v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12993v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.12993v1)

This work introduces a hierarchical strategy for terrain-aware bipedal locomotion that integrates reduced-dimensional perceptual representations to enhance reinforcement learning (RL)-based high-level (HL) policies for real-time gait generation. Unlike end-to-end approaches, our framework leverages latent terrain encodings via a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CNN-VAE) alongside reduced-order robot dynamics, optimizing the locomotion decision process with a compact state. We systematically analyze the impact of latent space dimensionality on learning efficiency and policy robustness. Additionally, we extend our method to be history-aware, incorporating sequences of recent terrain observations into the latent representation to improve robustness. To address real-world feasibility, we introduce a distillation method to learn the latent representation directly from depth camera images and provide preliminary hardware validation by comparing simulated and real sensor data. We further validate our framework using the high-fidelity Agility Robotics (AR) simulator, incorporating realistic sensor noise, state estimation, and actuator dynamics. The results confirm the robustness and adaptability of our method, underscoring its potential for hardware deployment.

### Tackling Snow-Induced Challenges: Safe Autonomous Lane-Keeping with Robust Reinforcement Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12987v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12987v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12987v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.12987v1)

This paper proposes two new algorithms for the lane keeping system (LKS) in autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating under snowy road conditions. These algorithms use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to handle uncertainties and slippage. They include Action-Robust Recurrent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-RDPG) and end-to-end Action-Robust convolutional neural network Attention Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-CADPG), two action-robust approaches for decision-making. In the AR-RDPG method, within the perception layer, camera images are first denoised using multi-scale neural networks. Then, the centerline coefficients are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). These coefficients, concatenated with the driving characteristics, are used as input to the control layer. The AR-CADPG method presents an end-to-end approach in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention mechanism are integrated within a DRL framework. Both methods are first trained in the CARLA simulator and validated under various snowy scenarios. Real-world experiments on a Jetson Nano-based autonomous vehicle confirm the feasibility and stability of the learned policies. Among the two models, the AR-CADPG approach demonstrates superior path-tracking accuracy and robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of combining temporal memory, adversarial resilience, and attention mechanisms in AVs.
