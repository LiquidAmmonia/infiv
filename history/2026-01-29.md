### FreeFix: Boosting 3D Gaussian Splatting via Fine-Tuning-Free Diffusion Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20857v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20857v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20857v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20857v1)

Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have advanced novel view synthesis, yet still rely on dense inputs and often degrade at extrapolated views. Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement. Experiments across multiple datasets show that FreeFix improves multi-frame consistency and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning-based methods, while retaining strong generalization ability.

### C3Box: A CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning Toolbox
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20852v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20852v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20852v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20852v1)

Traditional machine learning systems are typically designed for static data distributions, which suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning from evolving data streams. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) addresses this challenge by enabling learning systems to continuously learn new classes while preserving prior knowledge. With the rise of pre-trained models (PTMs) such as CLIP, leveraging their strong generalization and semantic alignment capabilities has become a promising direction in CIL. However, existing CLIP-based CIL methods are often scattered across disparate codebases, rely on inconsistent configurations, hindering fair comparisons, reproducibility, and practical adoption. Therefore, we propose C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental learning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive Python toolbox. C3Box integrates representative traditional CIL methods, ViT-based CIL methods, and state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods into a unified CLIP-based framework. By inheriting the streamlined design of PyCIL, C3Box provides a JSON-based configuration and standardized execution pipeline. This design enables reproducible experimentation with low engineering overhead and makes C3Box a reliable benchmark platform for continual learning research. Designed to be user-friendly, C3Box relies only on widely used open-source libraries and supports major operating systems. The code is available at https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/C3Box.

### A New Dataset and Framework for Robust Road Surface Classification via Camera-IMU Fusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20847v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20847v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20847v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20847v1)

Road surface classification (RSC) is a key enabler for environment-aware predictive maintenance systems. However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.

### Open-Vocabulary Functional 3D Human-Scene Interaction Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20835v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20835v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20835v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20835v1)

Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as "sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., "increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

### FAIRT2V: Training-Free Debiasing for Text-to-Video Diffusion Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20791v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20791v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20791v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20791v1)

Text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have achieved rapid progress, yet their demographic biases, particularly gender bias, remain largely unexplored. We present FairT2V, a training-free debiasing framework for text-to-video generation that mitigates encoder-induced bias without finetuning. We first analyze demographic bias in T2V models and show that it primarily originates from pretrained text encoders, which encode implicit gender associations even for neutral prompts. We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.
  Based on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule. We further propose a video-level fairness evaluation protocol combining VideoLLM-based reasoning with human verification. Experiments on the modern T2V model Open-Sora show that FairT2V substantially reduces demographic bias across occupations with minimal impact on video quality.

### Compression Tells Intelligence: Visual Coding, Visual Token Technology, and the Unification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20742v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20742v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20742v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20742v1)

"Compression Tells Intelligence", is supported by research in artificial intelligence, particularly concerning (multimodal) large language models (LLMs/MLLMs), where compression efficiency often correlates with improved model performance and capabilities. For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.

### Continual GUI Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20732v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20732v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20732v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20732v1)

As digital environments (data distribution) are in flux, with new GUI data arriving over time-introducing new domains or resolutions-agents trained on static environments deteriorate in performance. In this work, we introduce Continual GUI Agents, a new task that requires GUI agents to perform continual learning under shifted domains and resolutions. We find existing methods fail to maintain stable grounding as GUI distributions shift over time, due to the diversity of UI interaction points and regions in fluxing scenarios. To address this, we introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework that stabilizes continual learning through two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF). These rewards guide the agents to align with shifting interaction points and regions, mitigating the tendency of existing reward strategies to over-adapt to static grounding cues (e.g., fixed coordinates or element scales). Extensive experiments show GUI-AiF surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. Our work establishes the first continual learning framework for GUI agents, revealing the untapped potential of reinforcement fine-tuning for continual GUI Agents.

### Li-ViP3D++: Query-Gated Deformable Camera-LiDAR Fusion for End-to-End Perception and Trajectory Prediction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20720v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20720v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20720v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20720v1)

2026/01/28 15:53 GTM

End-to-end perception and trajectory prediction from raw sensor data is one of the key capabilities for autonomous driving. Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.

### Decoupling Perception and Calibration: Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20689v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20689v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20689v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20689v1)

Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in image quality assessment (IQA) tasks. However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations. Experiments on both user-generated and AI-generated IQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong MOS-aligned correlations, making lightweight IQA practical under limited annotation budgets.

### bi-modal textual prompt learning for vision-language models in remote sensing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20675v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20675v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20675v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20675v1)

Prompt learning (PL) has emerged as an effective strategy to adapt vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for downstream tasks under limited supervision. While PL has demonstrated strong generalization on natural image datasets, its transferability to remote sensing (RS) imagery remains underexplored. RS data present unique challenges, including multi-label scenes, high intra-class variability, and diverse spatial resolutions, that hinder the direct applicability of existing PL methods. In particular, current prompt-based approaches often struggle to identify dominant semantic cues and fail to generalize to novel classes in RS scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose BiMoRS, a lightweight bi-modal prompt learning framework tailored for RS tasks. BiMoRS employs a frozen image captioning model (e.g., BLIP-2) to extract textual semantic summaries from RS images. These captions are tokenized using a BERT tokenizer and fused with high-level visual features from the CLIP encoder. A lightweight cross-attention module then conditions a learnable query prompt on the fused textual-visual representation, yielding contextualized prompts without altering the CLIP backbone. We evaluate BiMoRS on four RS datasets across three domain generalization (DG) tasks and observe consistent performance gains, outperforming strong baselines by up to 2% on average. Codes are available at https://github.com/ipankhi/BiMoRS.

### ProSkill: Segment-Level Skill Assessment in Procedural Videos
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20661v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20661v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20661v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20661v1)

2026/01/28 14:44 GTM

Skill assessment in procedural videos is crucial for the objective evaluation of human performance in settings such as manufacturing and procedural daily tasks. Current research on skill assessment has predominantly focused on sports and lacks large-scale datasets for complex procedural activities. Existing studies typically involve only a limited number of actions, focus on either pairwise assessments (e.g., A is better than B) or on binary labels (e.g., good execution vs needs improvement). In response to these shortcomings, we introduce ProSkill, the first benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural tasks. ProSkill provides absolute skill assessment annotations, along with pairwise ones. This is enabled by a novel and scalable annotation protocol that allows for the creation of an absolute skill assessment ranking starting from pairwise assessments. This protocol leverages a Swiss Tournament scheme for efficient pairwise comparisons, which are then aggregated into consistent, continuous global scores using an ELO-based rating system. We use our dataset to benchmark the main state-of-the-art skill assessment algorithms, including both ranking-based and pairwise paradigms. The suboptimal results achieved by the current state-of-the-art highlight the challenges and thus the value of ProSkill in the context of skill assessment for procedural videos. All data and code are available at https://fpv-iplab.github.io/ProSkill/

### FD-MAD: Frequency-Domain Residual Analysis for Face Morphing Attack Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20656v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20656v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20656v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20656v1)

2026/01/28 14:38 GTM

Face morphing attacks present a significant threat to face recognition systems used in electronic identity enrolment and border control, particularly in single-image morphing attack detection (S-MAD) scenarios where no trusted reference is available. In spite of the vast amount of research on this problem, morph detection systems struggle in cross-dataset scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce a region-aware frequency-based morph detection strategy that drastically improves over strong baseline methods in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings using a lightweight approach. Having observed the separability of bona fide and morph samples in the frequency domain of different facial parts, our approach 1) introduces the concept of residual frequency domain, where the frequency of the signal is decoupled from the natural spectral decay to easily discriminate between morph and bona fide data; 2) additionally, we reason in a global and local manner by combining the evidence from different facial regions in a Markov Random Field, which infers a globally consistent decision. The proposed method, trained exclusively on the synthetic morphing attack detection development dataset (SMDD), is evaluated in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings on FRLL-Morph and MAD22 sets. Our approach achieves an average equal error rate (EER) of 1.85\% on FRLL-Morph and ranks second on MAD22 with an average EER of 6.12\%, while also obtaining a good bona fide presentation classification error rate (BPCER) at a low attack presentation classification error rate (APCER) using only spectral features. These findings indicate that Fourier-domain residual modeling with structured regional fusion offers a competitive alternative to deep S-MAD architectures.

### OS-Marathon: Benchmarking Computer-Use Agents on Long-Horizon Repetitive Tasks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20650v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20650v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20650v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20650v1)

Long-horizon, repetitive workflows are common in professional settings, such as processing expense reports from receipts and entering student grades from exam papers. These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the inherent challenges of these tasks and the effectiveness of our proposed method. Project website: https://os-marathon.github.io/.

### Detecting and Mitigating Memorization in Diffusion Models through Anisotropy of the Log-Probability
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20642v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20642v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20642v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20642v1)

2026/01/28 14:29 GTM

Diffusion-based image generative models produce high-fidelity images through iterative denoising but remain vulnerable to memorization, where they unintentionally reproduce exact copies or parts of training images. Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric.

### GDCNet: Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20618v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20618v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20618v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20618v1)

2026/01/28 13:51 GTM

Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcasm within image-text pairs by modeling semantic incongruities across modalities. Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.

### CLEAR-Mamba:Towards Accurate, Adaptive and Trustworthy Multi-Sequence Ophthalmic Angiography Classification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20601v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20601v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20601v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20601v1)

Medical image classification is a core task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), playing a pivotal role in early disease detection, treatment planning, and patient prognosis assessment. In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction. This study provides an effective solution that balances generalizability and reliability for modality-specific medical image classification tasks.

### Person Re-ID in 2025: Supervised, Self-Supervised, and Language-Aligned. What Works?
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20598v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20598v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20598v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20598v1)

Person Re-Identification (ReID) remains a challenging problem in computer vision. This work reviews various training paradigm and evaluates the robustness of state-of-the-art ReID models in cross-domain applications and examines the role of foundation models in improving generalization through richer, more transferable visual representations. We compare three training paradigms, supervised, self-supervised, and language-aligned models. Through the study the aim is to answer the following questions: Can supervised models generalize in cross-domain scenarios? How does foundation models like SigLIP2 perform for the ReID tasks? What are the weaknesses of current supervised and foundational models for ReID? We have conducted the analysis across 11 models and 9 datasets. Our results show a clear split: supervised models dominate their training domain but crumble on cross-domain data. Language-aligned models, however, show surprising robustness cross-domain for ReID tasks, even though they are not explicitly trained to do so.

### StructAlign: Structured Cross-Modal Alignment for Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20597v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20597v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20597v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20597v1)

Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) is a challenging multimodal continual learning setting, where models must incrementally learn new semantic categories while maintaining accurate text-video alignment for previously learned ones, thus making it particularly prone to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry. In addition, to suppress intra-modal feature drift, we design a Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss, which leverages complementary modalities to preserve cross-modal similarity relations, providing stable relational supervision for feature updates. By jointly addressing non-cooperative feature drift across modalities and intra-modal feature drift, StructAlign effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CTVR. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art continual retrieval approaches.

### SegRap2025: A Benchmark of Gross Tumor Volume and Lymph Node Clinical Target Volume Segmentation for Radiotherapy Planning of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20575v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20575v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20575v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20575v1)

Accurate delineation of Gross Tumor Volume (GTV), Lymph Node Clinical Target Volume (LN CTV), and Organ-at-Risk (OAR) from Computed Tomography (CT) scans is essential for precise radiotherapy planning in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Building upon SegRap2023, which focused on OAR and GTV segmentation using single-center paired non-contrast CT (ncCT) and contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) scans, the SegRap2025 challenge aims to enhance the generalizability and robustness of segmentation models across imaging centers and modalities. SegRap2025 comprises two tasks: Task01 addresses GTV segmentation using paired CT from the SegRap2023 dataset, with an additional external testing set to evaluate cross-center generalization, and Task02 focuses on LN CTV segmentation using multi-center training data and an unseen external testing set, where each case contains paired CT scans or a single modality, emphasizing both cross-center and cross-modality robustness. This paper presents the challenge setup and provides a comprehensive analysis of the solutions submitted by ten participating teams. For GTV segmentation task, the top-performing models achieved average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 74.61% and 56.79% on the internal and external testing cohorts, respectively. For LN CTV segmentation task, the highest average DSC values reached 60.24%, 60.50%, and 57.23% on paired CT, ceCT-only, and ncCT-only subsets, respectively. SegRap2025 establishes a large-scale multi-center, multi-modality benchmark for evaluating the generalization and robustness in radiotherapy target segmentation, providing valuable insights toward clinically applicable automated radiotherapy planning systems.

### DiffVC-RT: Towards Practical Real-Time Diffusion-based Perceptual Neural Video Compression
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20564v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20564v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20564v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20564v1)

The practical deployment of diffusion-based Neural Video Compression (NVC) faces critical challenges, including severe information loss, prohibitive inference latency, and poor temporal consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose DiffVC-RT, the first framework designed to achieve real-time diffusion-based perceptual NVC. First, we introduce an Efficient and Informative Model Architecture. Through strategic module replacements and pruning, this architecture significantly reduces computational complexity while mitigating structural information loss. Second, to address generative flickering artifacts, we propose Explicit and Implicit Consistency Modeling. We enhance temporal consistency by explicitly incorporating a zero-cost Online Temporal Shift Module within the U-Net, complemented by hybrid implicit consistency constraints. Finally, we present an Asynchronous and Parallel Decoding Pipeline incorporating Mixed Half Precision, which enables asynchronous latent decoding and parallel frame reconstruction via a Batch-dimension Temporal Shift design. Experiments show that DiffVC-RT achieves 80.1% bitrate savings in terms of LPIPS over VTM-17.0 on HEVC dataset with real-time encoding and decoding speeds of 206 / 30 fps for 720p videos on an NVIDIA H800 GPU, marking a significant milestone in diffusion-based video compression.

### DeepSeek-OCR 2: Visual Causal Flow
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20552v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20552v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20552v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20552v1)

We present DeepSeek-OCR 2 to investigate the feasibility of a novel encoder-DeepEncoder V2-capable of dynamically reordering visual tokens upon image semantics. Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning. Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2.

We provide public access to the code and model in an effort to narrow the divide between open-source and closed-source technologies. We believe our release will empower the community with practical applications across areas like content creation, gaming, and robot learning.

### IOTA: Corrective Knowledge-Guided Prompt Learning via Black-White Box Framework
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20526v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20526v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20526v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20526v1)

2026/01/28 12:03 GTM

Recently, adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks has attracted increasing interest. Previous Parameter-Efficient-Tuning (PET) methods regard the pre-trained model as an opaque Black Box model, relying purely on data-driven optimization and underutilizing their inherent prior knowledge. This oversight limits the models' potential for effective downstream task adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel black-whIte bOx prompT leArning framework (IOTA), which integrates a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module for downstream task adaptation. Specifically, the White Box module derives corrective knowledge by contrasting the wrong predictions with the right cognition. This knowledge is verbalized into interpretable human prompts and leveraged through a corrective knowledge-guided prompt selection strategy to guide the Black Box module toward more accurate predictions. By jointly leveraging knowledge- and data-driven learning signals, IOTA achieves effective downstream task adaptation. Experimental results on 12 image classification benchmarks under few-shot and easy-to-hard adaptation settings demonstrate the effectiveness of corrective knowledge and the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

### AnomalyVFM -- Transforming Vision Foundation Models into Zero-Shot Anomaly Detectors
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20524v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20524v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20524v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20524v1)

2026/01/28 12:02 GTM

Zero-shot anomaly detection aims to detect and localise abnormal regions in the image without access to any in-domain training images. While recent approaches leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to transfer high-level concept knowledge, methods based on purely vision foundation models (VFMs), like DINOv2, have lagged behind in performance. We argue that this gap stems from two practical issues: (i) limited diversity in existing auxiliary anomaly detection datasets and (ii) overly shallow VFM adaptation strategies. To address both challenges, we propose AnomalyVFM, a general and effective framework that turns any pretrained VFM into a strong zero-shot anomaly detector. Our approach combines a robust three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme with a parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism, utilising low-rank feature adapters and a confidence-weighted pixel loss. Together, these components enable modern VFMs to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically, with RADIO as a backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves an average image-level AUROC of 94.1% across 9 diverse datasets, surpassing previous methods by significant 3.3 percentage points.

### Context Tokens are Anchors: Understanding the Repetition Curse in dMLLMs from an Information Flow Perspective
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20520v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20520v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20520v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20520v1)

Recent diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) suffer from high inference latency and therefore rely on caching techniques to accelerate decoding. However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

### Say Cheese! Detail-Preserving Portrait Collection Generation via Natural Language Edits
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20511v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20511v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20511v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20511v1)

2026/01/28 11:41 GTM

As social media platforms proliferate, users increasingly demand intuitive ways to create diverse, high-quality portrait collections. In this work, we introduce Portrait Collection Generation (PCG), a novel task that generates coherent portrait collections by editing a reference portrait image through natural language instructions. This task poses two unique challenges to existing methods: (1) complex multi-attribute modifications such as pose, spatial layout, and camera viewpoint; and (2) high-fidelity detail preservation including identity, clothing, and accessories. To address these challenges, we propose CHEESE, the first large-scale PCG dataset containing 24K portrait collections and 573K samples with high-quality modification text annotations, constructed through an Large Vison-Language Model-based pipeline with inversion-based verification. We further propose SCheese, a framework that combines text-guided generation with hierarchical identity and detail preservation. SCheese employs adaptive feature fusion mechanism to maintain identity consistency, and ConsistencyNet to inject fine-grained features for detail consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CHEESE in advancing PCG, with SCheese achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### Latent Temporal Discrepancy as Motion Prior: A Loss-Weighting Strategy for Dynamic Fidelity in T2V
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20504v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20504v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20504v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20504v1)

2026/01/28 11:27 GTM

Video generation models have achieved notable progress in static scenarios, yet their performance in motion video generation remains limited, with quality degrading under drastic dynamic changes. This is due to noise disrupting temporal coherence and increasing the difficulty of learning dynamic regions. {Unfortunately, existing diffusion models rely on static loss for all scenarios, constraining their ability to capture complex dynamics.} To address this issue, we introduce Latent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD) as a motion prior to guide loss weighting. LTD measures frame-to-frame variation in the latent space, assigning larger penalties to regions with higher discrepancy while maintaining regular optimization for stable regions. This motion-aware strategy stabilizes training and enables the model to better reconstruct high-frequency dynamics. Extensive experiments on the general benchmark VBench and the motion-focused VMBench show consistent gains, with our method outperforming strong baselines by 3.31% on VBench and 3.58% on VMBench, achieving significant improvements in motion quality.

### Comparative evaluation of training strategies using partially labelled datasets for segmentation of white matter hyperintensities and stroke lesions in FLAIR MRI
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20503v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20503v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20503v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20503v1)

2026/01/28 11:27 GTM

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) and ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL) are imaging features associated with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) that are visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The development and validation of deep learning models to segment and differentiate these features is difficult because they visually confound each other in the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and often appear in the same subject. We investigated six strategies for training a combined WMH and ISL segmentation model using partially labelled data. We combined privately held fully and partially labelled datasets with publicly available partially labelled datasets to yield a total of 2052 MRI volumes, with 1341 and 1152 containing ground truth annotations for WMH and ISL respectively. We found that several methods were able to effectively leverage the partially labelled data to improve model performance, with the use of pseudolabels yielding the best result.

### Efficient Autoregressive Video Diffusion with Dummy Head
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20499v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20499v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20499v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20499v1)

2026/01/28 11:20 GTM

The autoregressive video diffusion model has recently gained considerable research interest due to its causal modeling and iterative denoising. In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop.

### Exploiting the Final Component of Generator Architectures for AI-Generated Image Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20461v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20461v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20461v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20461v1)

With the rapid proliferation of powerful image generators, accurate detection of AI-generated images has become essential for maintaining a trustworthy online environment. However, existing deepfake detectors often generalize poorly to images produced by unseen generators. Notably, despite being trained under vastly different paradigms, such as diffusion or autoregressive modeling, many modern image generators share common final architectural components that serve as the last stage for converting intermediate representations into images. Motivated by this insight, we propose to "contaminate" real images using the generator's final component and train a detector to distinguish them from the original real images. We further introduce a taxonomy based on generators' final components and categorize 21 widely used generators accordingly, enabling a comprehensive investigation of our method's generalization capability. Using only 100 samples from each of three representative categories, our detector-fine-tuned on the DINOv3 backbone-achieves an average accuracy of 98.83% across 22 testing sets from unseen generators.

### MARE: Multimodal Alignment and Reinforcement for Explainable Deepfake Detection via Vision-Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20433v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20433v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20433v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20433v1)

Deepfake detection is a widely researched topic that is crucial for combating the spread of malicious content, with existing methods mainly modeling the problem as classification or spatial localization. The rapid advancements in generative models impose new demands on Deepfake detection. In this paper, we propose multimodal alignment and reinforcement for explainable Deepfake detection via vision-language models, termed MARE, which aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in Deepfake detection and reasoning. Specifically, MARE designs comprehensive reward functions, incorporating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to incentivize the generation of text-spatially aligned reasoning content that adheres to human preferences. Besides, MARE introduces a forgery disentanglement module to capture intrinsic forgery traces from high-level facial semantics, thereby improving its authenticity detection capability. We conduct thorough evaluations on the reasoning content generated by MARE. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that MARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and reliability.

### Youtu-Parsing: Perception, Structuring and Recognition via High-Parallelism Decoding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20430v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20430v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20430v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20430v1)

2026/01/28 09:37 GTM

This paper presents Youtu-Parsing, an efficient and versatile document parsing model designed for high-performance content extraction. The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong robustness when handling rare characters, multilingual text, and handwritten content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both the OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks. Overall, Youtu-Parsing demonstrates significant experimental value and practical utility for large-scale document intelligence applications.

### GRTX: Efficient Ray Tracing for 3D Gaussian-Based Rendering
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20429v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20429v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20429v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20429v1)

2026/01/28 09:37 GTM

3D Gaussian Splatting has gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to its exceptional rendering performance and visual quality. While most existing methods rely on rasterization to render Gaussians, recent research has started investigating ray tracing approaches to overcome the fundamental limitations inherent in rasterization. However, current Gaussian ray tracing methods suffer from inefficiencies such as bloated acceleration structures and redundant node traversals, which greatly degrade ray tracing performance.
  In this work, we present GRTX, a set of software and hardware optimizations that enable efficient ray tracing for 3D Gaussian-based rendering. First, we introduce a novel approach for constructing streamlined acceleration structures for Gaussian primitives. Our key insight is that anisotropic Gaussians can be treated as unit spheres through ray space transformations, which substantially reduces BVH size and traversal overhead. Second, we propose dedicated hardware support for traversal checkpointing within ray tracing units. This eliminates redundant node visits during multi-round tracing by resuming traversal from checkpointed nodes rather than restarting from the root node in each subsequent round. Our evaluation shows that GRTX significantly improves ray tracing performance compared to the baseline ray tracing method with a negligible hardware cost.

### Quartet of Diffusions: Structure-Aware Point Cloud Generation through Part and Symmetry Guidance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20425v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20425v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20425v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20425v1)

2026/01/28 09:33 GTM

We introduce the Quartet of Diffusions, a structure-aware point cloud generation framework that explicitly models part composition and symmetry. Unlike prior methods that treat shape generation as a holistic process or only support part composition, our approach leverages four coordinated diffusion models to learn distributions of global shape latents, symmetries, semantic parts, and their spatial assembly. This structured pipeline ensures guaranteed symmetry, coherent part placement, and diverse, high-quality outputs. By disentangling the generative process into interpretable components, our method supports fine-grained control over shape attributes, enabling targeted manipulation of individual parts while preserving global consistency. A central global latent further reinforces structural coherence across assembled parts. Our experiments show that the Quartet achieves state-of-the-art performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first 3D point cloud generation framework that fully integrates and enforces both symmetry and part priors throughout the generative process.

### Let's Roll a BiFTA: Bi-refinement for Fine-grained Text-visual Alignment in Vision-Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20419v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20419v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20419v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20419v1)

2026/01/28 09:24 GTM

Recent research has shown that aligning fine-grained text descriptions with localized image patches can significantly improve the zero-shot performance of pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, we find that both fine-grained text descriptions and localized image patches often contain redundant information, making text-visual alignment less effective. In this paper, we tackle this issue from two perspectives: \emph{View Refinement} and \emph{Description refinement}, termed as \textit{\textbf{Bi}-refinement for \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{T}ext-visual \textbf{A}lignment} (BiFTA). \emph{View refinement} removes redundant image patches with high \emph{Intersection over Union} (IoU) ratios, resulting in more distinctive visual samples. \emph{Description refinement} removes redundant text descriptions with high pairwise cosine similarity, ensuring greater diversity in the remaining descriptions. BiFTA achieves superior zero-shot performance on 6 benchmark datasets for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP, justifying the necessity to remove redundant information in visual-text alignment.

### HINT: Hierarchical Interaction Modeling for Autoregressive Multi-Human Motion Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20383v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20383v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20383v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20383v1)

2026/01/28 08:47 GTM

Text-driven multi-human motion generation with complex interactions remains a challenging problem. Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HINT matches the performance of strong offline models and surpasses autoregressive baselines. Notably, on InterHuman, HINT achieves an FID of 3.100, significantly improving over the previous state-of-the-art score of 5.154.

### RepSFNet : A Single Fusion Network with Structural Reparameterization for Crowd Counting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20369v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20369v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20369v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20369v1)

2026/01/28 08:33 GTM

Crowd counting remains challenging in variable-density scenes due to scale variations, occlusions, and the high computational cost of existing models. To address these issues, we propose RepSFNet (Reparameterized Single Fusion Network), a lightweight architecture designed for accurate and real-time crowd estimation. RepSFNet leverages a RepLK-ViT backbone with large reparameterized kernels for efficient multi-scale feature extraction. It further integrates a Feature Fusion module combining Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and Context-Aware Network (CAN) to achieve robust, density-adaptive context modeling. A Concatenate Fusion module is employed to preserve spatial resolution and generate high-quality density maps. By avoiding attention mechanisms and multi-branch designs, RepSFNet significantly reduces parameters and computational complexity. The training objective combines Mean Squared Error and Optimal Transport loss to improve both count accuracy and spatial distribution alignment. Experiments conducted on ShanghaiTech, NWPU, and UCF-QNRF datasets demonstrate that RepSFNet achieves competitive accuracy while reducing inference latency by up to 34 percent compared to recent state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for real-time and low-power edge computing applications.

The integration of physical security systems with environmental safety monitoring represents a critical advancement in smart infrastructure management. Traditional approaches maintain these systems as independent silos, creating operational inefficiencies, delayed emergency responses, and increased management complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive dual-modality Internet of Things framework that seamlessly integrates RFID-based access control with multi-sensor environmental safety monitoring through a unified cloud architecture. The system comprises two coordinated subsystems: Subsystem 1 implements RFID authentication with servo-actuated gate control and real-time Google Sheets logging, while Subsystem 2 provides comprehensive safety monitoring incorporating flame detection, water flow measurement, LCD status display, and personnel identification. Both subsystems utilize ESP32 microcontrollers for edge processing and wireless connectivity. Experimental evaluation over 45 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: 99.2\% RFID authentication accuracy with 0.82-second average response time, 98.5\% flame detection reliability within 5-meter range, and 99.8\% cloud data logging success rate. The system maintains operational integrity during network disruptions through intelligent local caching mechanisms and achieves total implementation cost of 5,400 BDT (approximately \$48), representing an 82\% reduction compared to commercial integrated solutions. This research establishes a practical framework for synergistic security-safety integration, demonstrating that professional-grade performance can be achieved through careful architectural design and component optimization while maintaining exceptional cost-effectiveness and accessibility for diverse application scenarios.

### RAW-Flow: Advancing RGB-to-RAW Image Reconstruction with Deterministic Latent Flow Matching
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20364v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20364v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20364v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20364v1)

2026/01/28 08:27 GTM

RGB-to-RAW reconstruction, or the reverse modeling of a camera Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, aims to recover high-fidelity RAW data from RGB images. Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAW-Flow outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and visually.

### CURVE: Learning Causality-Inspired Invariant Representations for Robust Scene Understanding via Uncertainty-Guided Regularization

Scene graphs provide structured abstractions for scene understanding, yet they often overfit to spurious correlations, severely hindering out-of-distribution generalization. To address this limitation, we propose CURVE, a causality-inspired framework that integrates variational uncertainty modeling with uncertainty-guided structural regularization to suppress high-variance, environment-specific relations. Specifically, we apply prototype-conditioned debiasing to disentangle invariant interaction dynamics from environment-dependent variations, promoting a sparse and domain-stable topology. Empirically, we evaluate CURVE in zero-shot transfer and low-data sim-to-real adaptation, verifying its ability to learn domain-stable sparse topologies and provide reliable uncertainty estimates to support risk prediction under distribution shifts.

### Everything in Its Place: Benchmarking Spatial Intelligence of Text-to-Image Models

Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-fidelity images, but they often fail in handling complex spatial relationships, e.g., spatial perception, reasoning, or interaction. These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.

### PalmBridge: A Plug-and-Play Feature Alignment Framework for Open-Set Palmprint Verification
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20351v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20351v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20351v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20351v1)

Palmprint recognition is widely used in biometric systems, yet real-world performance often degrades due to feature distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous deployment conditions. Most deep palmprint models assume a closed and stationary distribution, leading to overfitting to dataset-specific textures rather than learning domain-invariant representations. Although data augmentation is commonly used to mitigate this issue, it assumes augmented samples can approximate the target deployment distribution, an assumption that often fails under significant domain mismatch. To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights. Experiments on multiple palmprint datasets and backbone architectures show that PalmBridge consistently reduces EER in intra-dataset open-set evaluation and improves cross-dataset generalization with negligible to modest runtime overhead.

### MMSF: Multitask and Multimodal Supervised Framework for WSI Classification and Survival Analysis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20347v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20347v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20347v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20347v1)

Multimodal evidence is critical in computational pathology: gigapixel whole slide images capture tumor morphology, while patient-level clinical descriptors preserve complementary context for prognosis. Integrating such heterogeneous signals remains challenging because feature spaces exhibit distinct statistics and scales. We introduce MMSF, a multitask and multimodal supervised framework built on a linear-complexity MIL backbone that explicitly decomposes and fuses cross-modal information. MMSF comprises a graph feature extraction module embedding tissue topology at the patch level, a clinical data embedding module standardizing patient attributes, a feature fusion module aligning modality-shared and modality-specific representations, and a Mamba-based MIL encoder with multitask prediction heads. Experiments on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCLC demonstrate 2.1--6.6\% accuracy and 2.2--6.9\% AUC improvements over competitive baselines, while evaluations on five TCGA survival cohorts yield 7.1--9.8\% C-index improvements compared with unimodal methods and 5.6--7.1\% over multimodal alternatives.

### Test-Time Adaptation for Anomaly Segmentation via Topology-Aware Optimal Transport Chaining
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20333v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20333v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20333v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20333v1)

Deep topological data analysis (TDA) offers a principled framework for capturing structural invariants such as connectivity and cycles that persist across scales, making it a natural fit for anomaly segmentation (AS). Unlike thresholdbased binarisation, which produces brittle masks under distribution shift, TDA allows anomalies to be characterised as disruptions to global structure rather than local fluctuations. We introduce TopoOT, a topology-aware optimal transport (OT) framework that integrates multi-filtration persistence diagrams (PDs) with test-time adaptation (TTA). Our key innovation is Optimal Transport Chaining, which sequentially aligns PDs across thresholds and filtrations, yielding geodesic stability scores that identify features consistently preserved across scales. These stabilityaware pseudo-labels supervise a lightweight head trained online with OT-consistency and contrastive objectives, ensuring robust adaptation under domain shift. Across standard 2D and 3D anomaly detection benchmarks, TopoOT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the most competitive methods by up to +24.1% mean F1 on 2D datasets and +10.2% on 3D AS benchmarks.

### GVGS: Gaussian Visibility-Aware Multi-View Geometry for Accurate Surface Reconstruction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20331v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20331v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20331v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20331v1)

3D Gaussian Splatting enables efficient optimization and high-quality rendering, yet accurate surface reconstruction remains challenging. Prior methods improve surface reconstruction by refining Gaussian depth estimates, either via multi-view geometric consistency or through monocular depth priors. However, multi-view constraints become unreliable under large geometric discrepancies, while monocular priors suffer from scale ambiguity and local inconsistency, ultimately leading to inaccurate Gaussian depth supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates the visibility of shared Gaussian primitives across views, enabling more accurate and stable geometric supervision. In addition, we propose a progressive quadtree-calibrated Monocular depth constraint that performs block-wise affine calibration from coarse to fine spatial scales, mitigating the scale ambiguity of depth priors while preserving fine-grained surface details. Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods. Codes are available at an anonymous repository: https://github.com/GVGScode/GVGS.

### UnlearnShield: Shielding Forgotten Privacy against Unlearning Inversion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20325v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20325v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20325v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20325v1)

2026/01/28 07:42 GTM

Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that aims to remove the influence of specific data from trained models, thereby enhancing privacy protection. However, recent research has uncovered critical privacy vulnerabilities, showing that adversaries can exploit unlearning inversion to reconstruct data that was intended to be erased. Despite the severity of this threat, dedicated defenses remain lacking. To address this gap, we propose UnlearnShield, the first defense specifically tailored to counter unlearning inversion. UnlearnShield introduces directional perturbations in the cosine representation space and regulates them through a constraint module to jointly preserve model accuracy and forgetting efficacy, thereby reducing inversion risk while maintaining utility. Experiments demonstrate that it achieves a good trade-off among privacy protection, accuracy, and forgetting.

### CPiRi: Channel Permutation-Invariant Relational Interaction for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20318v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20318v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20318v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20318v1)

2026/01/28 07:30 GTM

Current methods for multivariate time series forecasting can be classified into channel-dependent and channel-independent models. Channel-dependent models learn cross-channel features but often overfit the channel ordering, which hampers adaptation when channels are added or reordered. Channel-independent models treat each channel in isolation to increase flexibility, yet this neglects inter-channel dependencies and limits performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CPiRi}, a \textbf{channel permutation invariant (CPI)} framework that infers cross-channel structure from data rather than memorizing a fixed ordering, enabling deployment in settings with structural and distributional co-drift without retraining. CPiRi couples \textbf{spatio-temporal decoupling architecture} with \textbf{permutation-invariant regularization training strategy}: a frozen pretrained temporal encoder extracts high-quality temporal features, a lightweight spatial module learns content-driven inter-channel relations, while a channel shuffling strategy enforces CPI during training. We further \textbf{ground CPiRi in theory} by analyzing permutation equivariance in multivariate time series forecasting. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show state-of-the-art results. CPiRi remains stable when channel orders are shuffled and exhibits strong \textbf{inductive generalization} to unseen channels even when trained on \textbf{only half} of the channels, while maintaining \textbf{practical efficiency} on large-scale datasets. The source code is released at https://github.com/JasonStraka/CPiRi.

### SemBind: Binding Diffusion Watermarks to Semantics Against Black-Box Forgery Attacks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20310v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20310v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20310v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20310v1)

2026/01/28 07:02 GTM

Latent-based watermarks, integrated into the generation process of latent diffusion models (LDMs), simplify detection and attribution of generated images. However, recent black-box forgery attacks, where an attacker needs at least one watermarked image and black-box access to the provider's model, can embed the provider's watermark into images not produced by the provider, posing outsized risk to provenance and trust. We propose SemBind, the first defense framework for latent-based watermarks that resists black-box forgery by binding latent signals to image semantics via a learned semantic masker. Trained with contrastive learning, the masker yields near-invariant codes for the same prompt and near-orthogonal codes across prompts; these codes are reshaped and permuted to modulate the target latent before any standard latent-based watermark. SemBind is generally compatible with existing latent-based watermarking schemes and keeps image quality essentially unchanged, while a simple mask-ratio parameter offers a tunable trade-off between anti-forgery strength and robustness. Across four mainstream latent-based watermark methods, our SemBind-enabled anti-forgery variants markedly reduce false acceptance under black-box forgery while providing a controllable robustness-security balance.

### OSDEnhancer: Taming Real-World Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with One-Step Diffusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20308v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20308v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20308v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20308v1)

Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in video super-resolution (VSR), showcasing a powerful capacity for generating fine-grained details. However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior generalization capability in real-world scenarios.

### TPGDiff: Hierarchical Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion for Image Restoration
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20306v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20306v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20306v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20306v1)

All-in-one image restoration aims to address diverse degradation types using a single unified model. Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

### Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model for Unpaired Low-dose Computed Tomography Angiography Reconstruction

The application of iodinated contrast media (ICM) improves the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT) for a wide range of clinical indications. However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process. Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement. Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation. Qualitative analysis of visual comparison and quantitative results of several metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in angiographic reconstruction for low-dose contrast medium CT angiography.

### Physically Guided Visual Mass Estimation from a Single RGB Image

Estimating object mass from visual input is challenging because mass depends jointly on geometric volume and material-dependent density, neither of which is directly observable from RGB appearance. Consequently, mass prediction from pixels is ill-posed and therefore benefits from physically meaningful representations to constrain the space of plausible solutions. We propose a physically structured framework for single-image mass estimation that addresses this ambiguity by aligning visual cues with the physical factors governing mass. From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision. Experiments on image2mass and ABO-500 show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### Bridging the Applicator Gap with Data-Doping:Dual-Domain Learning for Precise Bladder Segmentation in CT-Guided Brachytherapy

Performance degradation due to covariate shift remains a major challenge for deep learning models in medical image segmentation. An open question is whether samples from a shifted distribution can effectively support learning when combined with limited target domain data. We investigate this problem in the context of bladder segmentation in CT guided gynecological brachytherapy, a critical task for accurate dose optimization and organ at risk sparing. While CT scans without brachytherapy applicators (no applicator: NA) are widely available, scans with applicators inserted (with applicator: WA) are scarce and exhibit substantial anatomical deformation and imaging artifacts, making automated segmentation particularly difficult.
  We propose a dual domain learning strategy that integrates NA and WA CT data to improve robustness and generalizability under covariate shift. Using a curated assorted dataset, we show that NA data alone fail to capture the anatomical and artifact related characteristics of WA images. However, introducing a modest proportion of WA data into a predominantly NA training set leads to significant performance improvements. Through systematic experiments across axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using multiple deep learning architectures, we demonstrate that doping only 10 to 30 percent WA data achieves segmentation performance comparable to models trained exclusively on WA data.
  The proposed approach attains Dice similarity coefficients of up to 0.94 and Intersection over Union scores of up to 0.92, indicating effective domain adaptation and improved clinical reliability. This study highlights the value of integrating anatomically similar but distribution shifted datasets to overcome data scarcity and enhance deep learning based segmentation for brachytherapy treatment planning.

### Towards Compact and Robust DNNs via Compression-aware Sharpness Minimization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20301v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20301v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20301v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20301v1)

2026/01/28 06:49 GTM

Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has recently emerged as an effective technique for improving DNN robustness to input variations. However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.

### Artifact-Aware Evaluation for High-Quality Video Generation

With the rapid advancement of video generation techniques, evaluating and auditing generated videos has become increasingly crucial. Existing approaches typically offer coarse video quality scores, lacking detailed localization and categorization of specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol focusing on three key aspects affecting human perception: Appearance, Motion, and Camera. We define these axes through a taxonomy of 10 prevalent artifact categories reflecting common generative failures observed in video generation. To enable robust artifact detection and categorization, we introduce GenVID, a large-scale dataset of 80k videos generated by various state-of-the-art video generation models, each carefully annotated for the defined artifact categories. Leveraging GenVID, we develop DVAR, a Dense Video Artifact Recognition framework for fine-grained identification and classification of generative artifacts. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves artifact detection accuracy and enables effective filtering of low-quality content.

### A Source-Free Approach for Domain Adaptation via Multiview Image Transformation and Latent Space Consistency

Domain adaptation (DA) addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain where image data distributions may differ. Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space. We also introduce a ConvNeXt-based encoder and design a loss function that combines classification and consistency objectives to drive effective adaptation directly from the target domain. The proposed model achieves an average classification accuracy of 90. 72\%, 84\%, and 97. 12\% in Office-31, Office-Home and Office-Caltech datasets, respectively. Further evaluations confirm that our study improves existing methods by an average classification accuracy increment of +1.23\%, +7.26\%, and +1.77\% on the respective datasets.

### Hallucination Begins Where Saliency Drops

Recent studies have examined attention dynamics in large vision-language models (LVLMs) to detect hallucinations. However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

### StreamFusion: Scalable Sequence Parallelism for Distributed Inference of Diffusion Transformers on GPUs

Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have gained increasing adoption in high-quality image and video generation. As demand for higher-resolution images and longer videos increases, single-GPU inference becomes inefficient due to increased latency and large activation sizes. Current frameworks employ sequence parallelism (SP) techniques such as Ulysses Attention and Ring Attention to scale inference. However, these implementations have three primary limitations: (1) suboptimal communication patterns for network topologies on modern GPU machines, (2) latency bottlenecks from all-to-all operations in inter-machine communication, and (3) GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads from using two-sided communication libraries. To address these issues, we present StreamFusion, a topology-aware efficient DiT serving engine. StreamFusion incorporates three key innovations: (1) a topology-aware sequence parallelism technique that accounts for inter- and intra-machine bandwidth differences, (2) Torus Attention, a novel SP technique enabling overlapping of inter-machine all-to-all operations with computation, and (3) a one-sided communication implementation that minimizes GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads. Our experiments demonstrate that StreamFusion outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by an average of $1.35\times$ (up to $1.77\times$).

### Evolutionary Strategies lead to Catastrophic Forgetting in LLMs

One of the biggest missing capabilities in current AI systems is the ability to learn continuously after deployment. Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.

Large language models (LLMs) can be benchmark-contaminated, resulting in inflated scores that mask memorization as generalization, and in multilingual settings, this memorization can even transfer to "uncontaminated" languages. Using the FLORES-200 translation benchmark as a diagnostic, we study two 7-8B instruction-tuned multilingual LLMs: Bloomz, which was trained on FLORES, and Llama as an uncontaminated control. We confirm Bloomz's FLORES contamination and demonstrate that machine translation contamination can be cross-directional, artificially boosting performance in unseen translation directions due to target-side memorization. Further analysis shows that recall of memorized references often persists despite various source-side perturbation efforts like paraphrasing and named entity replacement. However, replacing named entities leads to a consistent decrease in BLEU, suggesting an effective probing method for memorization in contaminated models.

### Reward Models Inherit Value Biases from Pretraining

Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values but have received less attention than pre-trained and post-trained LLMs themselves. Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the "Big Two" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for "agency" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for "communion." This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.

### Linear representations in language models can change dramatically over a conversation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20834v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20834v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20834v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20834v1)

Language model representations often contain linear directions that correspond to high-level concepts. Here, we study the dynamics of these representations: how representations evolve along these dimensions within the context of (simulated) conversations. We find that linear representations can change dramatically over a conversation; for example, information that is represented as factual at the beginning of a conversation can be represented as non-factual at the end and vice versa. These changes are content-dependent; while representations of conversation-relevant information may change, generic information is generally preserved. These changes are robust even for dimensions that disentangle factuality from more superficial response patterns, and occur across different model families and layers of the model. These representation changes do not require on-policy conversations; even replaying a conversation script written by an entirely different model can produce similar changes. However, adaptation is much weaker from simply having a sci-fi story in context that is framed more explicitly as such. We also show that steering along a representational direction can have dramatically different effects at different points in a conversation. These results are consistent with the idea that representations may evolve in response to the model playing a particular role that is cued by a conversation. Our findings may pose challenges for interpretability and steering -- in particular, they imply that it may be misleading to use static interpretations of features or directions, or probes that assume a particular range of features consistently corresponds to a particular ground-truth value. However, these types of representational dynamics also point to exciting new research directions for understanding how models adapt to context.

### Training Reasoning Models on Saturated Problems via Failure-Prefix Conditioning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20829v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20829v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20829v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20829v1)

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.

### Structured Semantic Information Helps Retrieve Better Examples for In-Context Learning in Few-Shot Relation Extraction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20803v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20803v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20803v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20803v1)

This paper presents several strategies to automatically obtain additional examples for in-context learning of one-shot relation extraction. Specifically, we introduce a novel strategy for example selection, in which new examples are selected based on the similarity of their underlying syntactic-semantic structure to the provided one-shot example. We show that this method results in complementary word choices and sentence structures when compared to LLM-generated examples. When these strategies are combined, the resulting hybrid system achieves a more holistic picture of the relations of interest than either method alone. Our framework transfers well across datasets (FS-TACRED and FS-FewRel) and LLM families (Qwen and Gemma). Overall, our hybrid selection method consistently outperforms alternative strategies and achieves state-of-the-art performance on FS-TACRED and strong gains on a customized FewRel subset.

### Dissecting Multimodal In-Context Learning: Modality Asymmetries and Circuit Dynamics in modern Transformers
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20796v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20796v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20796v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20796v1)

Transformer-based multimodal large language models often exhibit in-context learning (ICL) abilities. Motivated by this phenomenon, we ask: how do transformers learn to associate information across modalities from in-context examples? We investigate this question through controlled experiments on small transformers trained on synthetic classification tasks, enabling precise manipulation of data statistics and model architecture. We begin by revisiting core principles of unimodal ICL in modern transformers. While several prior findings replicate, we find that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) increases the data complexity threshold for ICL. Extending to the multimodal setting reveals a fundamental learning asymmetry: when pretrained on high-diversity data from a primary modality, surprisingly low data complexity in the secondary modality suffices for multimodal ICL to emerge. Mechanistic analysis shows that both settings rely on an induction-style mechanism that copies labels from matching in-context exemplars; multimodal training refines and extends these circuits across modalities. Our findings provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding multimodal ICL in modern transformers and introduce a controlled testbed for future investigation.

### Jurisdiction as Structural Barrier: How Privacy Policy Organization May Reduce Visibility of Substantive Disclosures
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20792v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20792v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20792v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20792v1)

Privacy policies are supposed to provide notice. But what if substantive information appears only where users skip it? We identify a structural pattern we call jurisdiction-siloed disclosure: information about data practices appearing in specific, actionable form only within regional compliance sections labeled "California Residents" or "EU/UK Users," while general sections use vague or qualified language for the same practices.
  Our audit of 123 major companies identifies 282 potential instances across 77 companies (62.6% of this purposive sample). A conservative estimate restricted to practice categories validated against OPP-115 human annotations finds 138 instances across 54 companies (44%); post-2018 categories central to our findings await independent validation. If users skip jurisdiction-labeled sections as information foraging theory predicts, users outside regulated jurisdictions would receive less specific information about practices affecting them--a transparency failure operating through document architecture rather than omission.
  We propose universal substantive disclosure: practices affecting all users should appear in the main policy body, with regional sections containing only procedural rights information. This standard finds support in analogous disclosure regimes (securities, truth-in-lending, nutritional labeling) where material information must reach all affected parties. Regulators could operationalize this through the FTC's "clear and conspicuous" standard and GDPR transparency principles.
  This work is hypothesis-generating: we establish that the structural pattern exists and ground the transparency concern in behavioral theory, but direct measurement of jurisdiction-specific section skipping remains the critical validation priority. We release our methodology and annotated dataset to enable replication.

### SERA: Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents

Open-weight coding agents should hold a fundamental advantage over closed-source systems: they can be specialized to private codebases, encoding repository-specific information directly in their weights. Yet the cost and complexity of training has kept this advantage theoretical. We show it is now practical. We present Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA), an efficient method for training coding agents that enables the rapid and cheap creation of agents specialized to private codebases. Using only supervised finetuning (SFT), SERA achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open-source (open data, method, code) models while matching the performance of frontier open-weight models like Devstral-Small-2. Creating SERA models is 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods to reach equivalent performance. Our method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from a single code repository. Combined with cost-efficiency, this enables specialization to private codebases. Beyond repository specialization, we apply SVG to a larger corpus of codebases, generating over 200,000 synthetic trajectories. We use this dataset to provide detailed analysis of scaling laws, ablations, and confounding factors for training coding agents. Overall, we believe our work will greatly accelerate research on open coding agents and showcase the advantage of open-source models that can specialize to private codebases. We release SERA as the first model in Ai2's Open Coding Agents series, along with all our code, data, and Claude Code integration to support the research community.

### Persona Prompting as a Lens on LLM Social Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20757v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20757v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20757v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20757v1)

For socially sensitive tasks like hate speech detection, the quality of explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for factors like user trust and model alignment. While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.

### Like a Therapist, But Not: Reddit Narratives of AI in Mental Health Contexts
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20747v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20747v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20747v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20747v1)

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for emotional support and mental health-related interactions outside clinical settings, yet little is known about how people evaluate and relate to these systems in everyday use. We analyze 5,126 Reddit posts from 47 mental health communities describing experiential or exploratory use of AI for emotional support or therapy. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory, we develop a theory-informed annotation framework and apply a hybrid LLM-human pipeline to analyze evaluative language, adoption-related attitudes, and relational alignment at scale. Our results show that engagement is shaped primarily by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, rather than emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment is most strongly associated with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use more often involves misaligned alliances and reported risks such as dependence and symptom escalation. Overall, this work demonstrates how theory-grounded constructs can be operationalized in large-scale discourse analysis and highlights the importance of studying how users interpret language technologies in sensitive, real-world contexts.

### QueerGen: How LLMs Reflect Societal Norms on Gender and Sexuality in Sentence Completion Tasks
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20731v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20731v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20731v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20731v1)

2026/01/28 16:06 GTM

This paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce societal norms, particularly heterocisnormativity, and how these norms translate into measurable biases in their text generations. We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized "unmarked" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.

### AgentLongBench: A Controllable Long Benchmark For Long-Contexts Agents via Environment Rollouts

The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.

### Polite But Boring? Trade-offs Between Engagement and Psychological Reactance to Chatbot Feedback Styles

As conversational agents become increasingly common in behaviour change interventions, understanding optimal feedback delivery mechanisms becomes increasingly important. However, choosing a style that both lessens psychological reactance (perceived threats to freedom) while simultaneously eliciting feelings of surprise and engagement represents a complex design problem. We explored how three different feedback styles: 'Direct', 'Politeness', and 'Verbal Leakage' (slips or disfluencies to reveal a desired behaviour) affect user perceptions and behavioural intentions. Matching expectations from literature, the 'Direct' chatbot led to lower behavioural intentions and higher reactance, while the 'Politeness' chatbot evoked higher behavioural intentions and lower reactance. However, 'Politeness' was also seen as unsurprising and unengaging by participants. In contrast, 'Verbal Leakage' evoked reactance, yet also elicited higher feelings of surprise, engagement, and humour. These findings highlight that effective feedback requires navigating trade-offs between user reactance and engagement, with novel approaches such as 'Verbal Leakage' offering promising alternative design opportunities.

### Online Density-Based Clustering for Real-Time Narrative Evolution Monitorin

Automated narrative intelligence systems for social media monitoring face significant scalability challenges when processing continuous data streams using traditional batch clustering algorithms. We investigate the replacement of HDBSCAN (offline clustering) with online (streaming/incremental) clustering methods in a production narrative report generation pipeline. The proposed system employs a three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) that processes thousands of multilingual social media documents daily. While HDBSCAN excels at discovering hierarchical density-based clusters and handling noise, its batch-only nature necessitates complete retraining for each time window, resulting in memory constraints, computational inefficiency, and inability to adapt to evolving narratives in real-time. This work evaluates a bunch of online clustering algorithms across dimensions of cluster quality preservation, computational efficiency, memory footprint, and integration compatibility with existing workflows. We propose evaluation criteria that balance traditional clustering metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index) with narrative metrics (narrative distinctness, contingency and variance). Our methodology includes sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine information space, enabling comparative analysis of algorithmic trade-offs in realistic operational contexts. This research addresses a critical gap between batch-oriented topic modeling frameworks and the streaming nature of social media monitoring, with implications for computational social science, crisis informatics, and narrative surveillance systems.

### ShieldedCode: Learning Robust Representations for Virtual Machine Protected Code
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20679v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20679v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20679v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20679v1)

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, yet their potential for software protection remains largely untapped. Reverse engineering continues to threaten software security, while traditional virtual machine protection (VMP) relies on rigid, rule-based transformations that are costly to design and vulnerable to automated analysis. In this work, we present the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our approach builds large-scale paired datasets of source code and normalized VM implementations, and introduces hierarchical dependency modeling at intra-, preceding-, and inter-instruction levels. We jointly optimize language modeling with functionality-aware and protection-aware contrastive objectives to capture both semantic equivalence and protection strength. To further assess resilience, we propose a protection effectiveness optimization task that quantifies and ranks different VM variants derived from the same source. Coupled with a two-stage continual pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, our method enables models to generate, compare, and reason over protected code. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves robustness across diverse protection levels, opening a new research direction for learning-based software defense. In this work, we present ShieldedCode, the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our method achieves 26.95% Pass@1 on L0 VM code generation compared to 22.58% for GPT-4o., and improves binary similarity detection Recall@1 by 10% over state of art methods like jTrans.

### Efficient Multimodal Planning Agent for Visual Question-Answering
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20676v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20676v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20676v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20676v1)

Visual Question-Answering (VQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires integrating visual and textual information to generate accurate responses. While multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has shown promise in enhancing VQA systems by providing more evidence on both image and text sides, the default procedure that addresses VQA queries, especially the knowledge-intensive ones, often relies on multi-stage pipelines of mRAG with inherent dependencies. To mitigate the inefficiency limitations while maintaining VQA task performance, this paper proposes a method that trains a multimodal planning agent, dynamically decomposing the mRAG pipeline to solve the VQA task. Our method optimizes the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness by training the agent to intelligently determine the necessity of each mRAG step. In our experiments, the agent can help reduce redundant computations, cutting search time by over 60\% compared to existing methods and decreasing costly tool calls. Meanwhile, experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, including a Deep Research agent and a carefully designed prompt-based method, on average over six various datasets. Code will be released.

### Harnessing Large Language Models for Precision Querying and Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Extraction in Clinical Data Science

This study applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to two foundational Electronic Health Record (EHR) data science tasks: structured data querying (using programmatic languages, Python/Pandas) and information extraction from unstructured clinical text via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We test the ability of LLMs to interact accurately with large structured datasets for analytics and the reliability of LLMs in extracting semantically correct information from free text health records when supported by RAG. To this end, we presented a flexible evaluation framework that automatically generates synthetic question and answer pairs tailored to the characteristics of each dataset or task. Experiments were conducted on a curated subset of MIMIC III, (four structured tables and one clinical note type), using a mix of locally hosted and API-based LLMs. Evaluation combined exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to support precise querying and accurate information extraction in clinical workflows.

### A Dialectic Pipeline for Improving LLM Robustness

Assessing ways in which Language Models can reduce their hallucinations and improve the outputs' quality is crucial to ensure their large-scale use.
  However, methods such as fine-tuning on domain-specific data or the training of a separate \textit{ad hoc} verifier require demanding computational resources (not feasible for many user applications) and constrain the models to specific fields of knowledge.
  In this thesis, we propose a dialectic pipeline that preserves LLMs' generalization abilities while improving the quality of its answer via self-dialogue, enabling it to reflect upon and correct tentative wrong answers.
  We experimented with different pipeline settings, testing our proposed method on different datasets and on different families of models. All the pipeline stages are enriched with the relevant context (in an oracle-RAG setting) and a study on the impact of its summarization or its filtering is conducted.
  We find that our proposed dialectic pipeline is able to outperform by significative margins the standard model answers and that it consistently achieves higher performances than Chain-of-Thought only prompting.

### P2S: Probabilistic Process Supervision for General-Domain Reasoning Question Answering
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20649v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20649v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20649v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20649v1)

While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning in structured domains like mathematics and programming, its application to general-domain reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of verifiable reward signals. To this end, methods like Reinforcement Learning with Reference Probability Reward (RLPR) have emerged, leveraging the probability of generating the final answer as a reward signal. However, these outcome-focused approaches neglect crucial step-by-step supervision of the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we introduce Probabilistic Process Supervision (P2S), a novel self-supervision framework that provides fine-grained process rewards without requiring a separate reward model or human-annotated reasoning steps. During reinforcement learning, P2S synthesizes and filters a high-quality reference reasoning chain (gold-CoT). The core of our method is to calculate a Path Faithfulness Reward (PFR) for each reasoning step, which is derived from the conditional probability of generating the gold-CoT's suffix, given the model's current reasoning prefix. Crucially, this PFR can be flexibly integrated with any outcome-based reward, directly tackling the reward sparsity problem by providing dense guidance. Extensive experiments on reading comprehension and medical Question Answering benchmarks show that P2S significantly outperforms strong baselines.

### GDCNet: Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20618v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20618v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20618v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20618v1)

Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcasm within image-text pairs by modeling semantic incongruities across modalities. Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.

### Harder Is Better: Boosting Mathematical Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware GRPO and Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20614v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20614v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20614v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20614v1)

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks.

### AgentIF-OneDay: A Task-level Instruction-Following Benchmark for General AI Agents in Daily Scenarios
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20613v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20613v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20613v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20613v1)

The capacity of AI agents to effectively handle tasks of increasing duration and complexity continues to grow, demonstrating exceptional performance in coding, deep research, and complex problem-solving evaluations. However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.

### A Computational Approach to Language Contact -- A Case Study of Persian
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20592v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20592v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20592v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20592v1)

We investigate structural traces of language contact in the intermediate representations of a monolingual language model. Focusing on Persian (Farsi) as a historically contact-rich language, we probe the representations of a Persian-trained model when exposed to languages with varying degrees and types of contact with Persian. Our methodology quantifies the amount of linguistic information encoded in intermediate representations and assesses how this information is distributed across model components for different morphosyntactic features. The results show that universal syntactic information is largely insensitive to historical contact, whereas morphological features such as Case and Gender are strongly shaped by language-specific structure, suggesting that contact effects in monolingual language models are selective and structurally constrained.

### Single-Nodal Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in NLP Models

Spontaneous symmetry breaking in statistical mechanics primarily occurs during phase transitions at the thermodynamic limit where the Hamiltonian preserves inversion symmetry, yet the low-temperature free energy exhibits reduced symmetry. Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis. Results are demonstrated using BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel classification task.

### Beyond Divergent Creativity: A Human-Based Evaluation of Creativity in Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20546v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20546v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20546v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20546v1)

2026/01/28 12:41 GTM

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in verbal creative tasks. However, previous assessments of the creative capabilities of LLMs remain weakly grounded in human creativity theory and are thus hard to interpret. The widely used Divergent Association Task (DAT) focuses on novelty, ignoring appropriateness, a core component of creativity. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs on DAT and show that their scores on the task are lower than those of two baselines that do not possess any creative abilities, undermining its validity for model evaluation. Grounded in human creativity theory, which defines creativity as the combination of novelty and appropriateness, we introduce Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT). CDAT evaluates novelty conditional on contextual appropriateness, separating noise from creativity better than DAT, while remaining simple and objective. Under CDAT, smaller model families often show the most creativity, whereas advanced families favor appropriateness at lower novelty. We hypothesize that training and alignment likely shift models along this frontier, making outputs more appropriate but less creative. We release the dataset and code.

### PathWise: Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20539v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20539v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20539v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20539v1)

2026/01/28 12:34 GTM

Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.

### Can We Improve Educational Diagram Generation with In-Context Examples? Not if a Hallucination Spoils the Bunch
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20476v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20476v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20476v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20476v1)

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has found a widespread use in computing education; at the same time, quality of generated materials raises concerns among educators and students. This study addresses this issue by introducing a novel method for diagram code generation with in-context examples based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), which aims to improve diagram generation by aligning models' output with user expectations. Our approach is evaluated by computer science educators, who assessed 150 diagrams generated with large language models (LLMs) for logical organization, connectivity, layout aesthetic, and AI hallucination. The assessment dataset is additionally investigated for its utility in automated diagram evaluation. The preliminary results suggest that our method decreases the rate of factual hallucination and improves diagram faithfulness to provided context; however, due to LLMs' stochasticity, the quality of the generated diagrams varies. Additionally, we present an in-depth analysis and discussion on the connection between AI hallucination and the quality of generated diagrams, which reveals that text contexts of higher complexity lead to higher rates of hallucination and LLMs often fail to detect mistakes in their output.

### CtrlCoT: Dual-Granularity Chain-of-Thought Compression for Controllable Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20467v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20467v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20467v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20467v1)

2026/01/28 10:38 GTM

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves LLM reasoning but incurs high latency and memory cost due to verbose traces, motivating CoT compression with preserved correctness. Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/fanzhenxuan/Ctrl-CoT.

### BMAM: Brain-inspired Multi-Agent Memory Framework
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20465v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20465v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20465v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20465v1)

2026/01/28 10:36 GTM

Language-model-based agents operating over extended interaction horizons face persistent challenges in preserving temporally grounded information and maintaining behavioral consistency across sessions, a failure mode we term soul erosion. We present BMAM (Brain-inspired Multi-Agent Memory), a general-purpose memory architecture that models agent memory as a set of functionally specialized subsystems rather than a single unstructured store. Inspired by cognitive memory systems, BMAM decomposes memory into episodic, semantic, salience-aware, and control-oriented components that operate at complementary time scales. To support long-horizon reasoning, BMAM organizes episodic memories along explicit timelines and retrieves evidence by fusing multiple complementary signals. Experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark show that BMAM achieves 78.45 percent accuracy under the standard long-horizon evaluation setting, and ablation analyses confirm that the hippocampus-inspired episodic memory subsystem plays a critical role in temporal reasoning.

### MuVaC: AVariational Causal Framework for Multimodal Sarcasm Understanding in Dialogues
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20451v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20451v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20451v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20451v1)

The prevalence of sarcasm in multimodal dialogues on the social platforms presents a crucial yet challenging task for understanding the true intent behind online content. Comprehensive sarcasm analysis requires two key aspects: Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD) and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE). Intuitively, the act of detection is the result of the reasoning process that explains the sarcasm. Current research predominantly focuses on addressing either MSD or MuSE as a single task. Even though some recent work has attempted to integrate these tasks, their inherent causal dependency is often overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose MuVaC, a variational causal inference framework that mimics human cognitive mechanisms for understanding sarcasm, enabling robust multimodal feature learning to jointly optimize MSD and MuSE. Specifically, we first model MSD and MuSE from the perspective of structural causal models, establishing variational causal pathways to define the objectives for joint optimization. Next, we design an alignment-then-fusion approach to integrate multimodal features, providing robust fusion representations for sarcasm detection and explanation generation. Finally, we enhance the reasoning trustworthiness by ensuring consistency between detection results and explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MuVaC in public datasets, offering a new perspective for understanding multimodal sarcasm.

### PEARL: Plan Exploration and Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Multihop Tool Use

Large Language Models show great potential with external tools, but face significant challenges in complex, multi-turn tool invocation. They often exhibit weak planning, tool hallucination, erroneous parameter generation, and struggle with robust interaction. To tackle these issues, we present PEARL, a novel framework to enhance LLM planning and execution for sophisticated tool use. PEARL adopts a two-stage approach: an offline phase where the agent explores tools to learn valid usage patterns and failure conditions, and an online reinforcement learning phase. In the online phase, a dedicated Planner is trained via group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a carefully designed reward function that provides distinct signals for planning quality. Experiments on the ToolHop and T-Eval benchmarks show PEARL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art success rate of \textbf{56.5\%} on ToolHop while maintaining a low invocation error rate. Our work marks a key advance in addressing the complex planning challenges of tool use, contributing to the development of more robust and reliable LLM-based agents.

### Hopes and Fears -- Emotion Distribution in the Topic Landscape of Finnish Parliamentary Speech 2000-2020
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20424v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20424v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20424v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20424v1)

Existing research often treats parliamentary discourse as a homogeneous whole, overlooking topic-specific patterns. Parliamentary speeches address a wide range of topics, some of which evoke stronger emotions than others. While everyone has intuitive assumptions about what the most emotive topics in a parliament may be, there has been little research into the emotions typically linked to different topics. This paper strives to fill this gap by examining emotion expression among the topics of parliamentary speeches delivered in Eduskunta, the Finnish Parliament, between 2000 and 2020. An emotion analysis model is used to investigate emotion expression in topics, from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. The results strengthen evidence of increasing positivity in parliamentary speech and provide further insights into topic-specific emotion expression within parliamentary debate.

### SpeechMapper: Speech-to-text Embedding Projector for LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20417v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20417v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20417v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20417v1)

2026/01/28 09:22 GTM

Current speech LLMs bridge speech foundation models to LLMs using projection layers, training all of these components on speech instruction data. This strategy is computationally intensive and susceptible to task and prompt overfitting. We present SpeechMapper, a cost-efficient speech-to-LLM-embedding training approach that mitigates overfitting, enabling more robust and generalizable models. Our model is first pretrained without the LLM on inexpensive hardware, and then efficiently attached to the target LLM via a brief 1K-step instruction tuning (IT) stage. Through experiments on speech translation and spoken question answering, we demonstrate the versatility of SpeechMapper's pretrained block, presenting results for both task-agnostic IT, an ASR-based adaptation strategy that does not train in the target task, and task-specific IT. In task-agnostic settings, Speechmapper rivals the best instruction-following speech LLM from IWSLT25, despite never being trained on these tasks, while in task-specific settings, it outperforms this model across many datasets, despite requiring less data and compute. Overall, SpeechMapper offers a practical and scalable approach for efficient, generalizable speech-LLM integration without large-scale IT.

### Beyond Accuracy: A Cognitive Load Framework for Mapping the Capability Boundaries of Tool-use Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20412v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20412v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20412v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20412v1)

The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to use external tools unlocks powerful real-world interactions, making rigorous evaluation essential. However, current benchmarks primarily report final accuracy, revealing what models can do but obscuring the cognitive bottlenecks that define their true capability boundaries. To move from simple performance scoring to a diagnostic tool, we introduce a framework grounded in Cognitive Load Theory. Our framework deconstructs task complexity into two quantifiable components: Intrinsic Load, the inherent structural complexity of the solution path, formalized with a novel Tool Interaction Graph; and Extraneous Load, the difficulty arising from ambiguous task presentation. To enable controlled experiments, we construct ToolLoad-Bench, the first benchmark with parametrically adjustable cognitive load. Our evaluation reveals distinct performance cliffs as cognitive load increases, allowing us to precisely map each model's capability boundary. We validate that our framework's predictions are highly calibrated with empirical results, establishing a principled methodology for understanding an agent's limits and a practical foundation for building more efficient systems.

### LLM-AutoDP: Automatic Data Processing via LLM Agents for Model Fine-tuning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20375v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20375v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20375v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20375v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

### TABED: Test-Time Adaptive Ensemble Drafting for Robust Speculative Decoding in LVLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20357v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20357v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20357v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20357v1)

2026/01/28 08:16 GTM

Speculative decoding (SD) has proven effective for accelerating LLM inference by quickly generating draft tokens and verifying them in parallel. However, SD remains largely unexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which extend LLMs to process both image and text prompts. To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing. With its plug-and-play compatibility, we further enhance TABED by integrating advanced verification and alternative drafting methods. Code and custom-trained models are available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/TABED.

### Improving Diffusion Language Model Decoding through Joint Search in Generation Order and Token Space
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20339v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20339v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20339v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20339v1)

2026/01/28 07:55 GTM

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer order-agnostic generation that can explore many possible decoding trajectories. However, current decoding methods commit to a single trajectory, limiting exploration in trajectory space. We introduce Order-Token Search to explore this space through jointly searching over generation order and token values. Its core is a likelihood estimator that scores denoising actions, enabling stable pruning and efficient exploration of diverse trajectories. Across mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks, Order-Token Search consistently outperforms baselines on GSM8K, MATH500, Countdown, and HumanEval (3.1%, 3.8%, 7.9%, and 6.8% absolute over backbone), matching or surpassing diffu-GRPO post-trained d1-LLaDA. Our work establishes joint search as a key component for advancing decoding in DLMs.

### MobileBench-OL: A Comprehensive Chinese Benchmark for Evaluating Mobile GUI Agents in Real-World Environment
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20335v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20335v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20335v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20335v1)

2026/01/28 07:49 GTM

Recent advances in mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents highlight the growing need for comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. While new online benchmarks offer more realistic testing than offline ones, they tend to focus on the agents' task instruction-following ability while neglecting their reasoning and exploration ability. Moreover, these benchmarks do not consider the random noise in real-world mobile environments. This leads to a gap between benchmarks and real-world environments. To addressing these limitations, we propose MobileBench-OL, an online benchmark with 1080 tasks from 80 Chinese apps. It measures task execution, complex reasoning, and noise robustness of agents by including 5 subsets, which set multiple evaluation dimensions. We also provide an auto-eval framework with a reset mechanism, enabling stable and repeatable real-world benchmarking. Evaluating 12 leading GUI agents on MobileBench-OL shows significant room for improvement to meet real-world requirements. Human evaluation further confirms that MobileBench-OL can reliably measure the performance of leading GUI agents in real environments. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.

### PsychePass: Calibrating LLM Therapeutic Competence via Trajectory-Anchored Tournaments
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20330v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20330v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20330v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20330v1)

2026/01/28 07:48 GTM

While large language models show promise in mental healthcare, evaluating their therapeutic competence remains challenging due to the unstructured and longitudinal nature of counseling. We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.

### CE-RM: A Pointwise Generative Reward Model Optimized via Two-Stage Rollout and Unified Criteria
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20327v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20327v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20327v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20327v1)

2026/01/28 07:46 GTM

Automatic evaluation is crucial yet challenging for open-ended natural language generation, especially when rule-based metrics are infeasible. Compared with traditional methods, the recent LLM-as-a-Judge paradigms enable better and more flexible evaluation, and show promise as generative reward models for reinforcement learning. However, prior work has revealed a notable gap between their seemingly impressive benchmark performance and actual effectiveness in RL practice. We attribute this issue to some limitations in existing studies, including the dominance of pairwise evaluation and inadequate optimization of evaluation criteria. Therefore, we propose CE-RM-4B, a pointwise generative reward model trained with a dedicated two-stage rollout method, and adopting unified query-based criteria. Using only about 5.7K high-quality data curated from the open-source preference dataset, our CE-RM-4B achieves superior performance on diverse reward model benchmarks, especially in Best-of-N scenarios, and delivers more effective improvements in downstream RL practice.

### Beyond Speedup -- Utilizing KV Cache for Sampling and Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20326v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20326v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20326v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20326v1)

KV caches, typically used only to speed up autoregressive decoding, encode contextual information that can be reused for downstream tasks at no extra cost. We propose treating the KV cache as a lightweight representation, eliminating the need to recompute or store full hidden states. Despite being weaker than dedicated embeddings, KV-derived representations are shown to be sufficient for two key applications: \textbf{(i) Chain-of-Embedding}, where they achieve competitive or superior performance on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct; and \textbf{(ii) Fast/Slow Thinking Switching}, where they enable adaptive reasoning on Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distil-Qwen-14B, reducing token generation by up to $5.7\times$ with minimal accuracy loss. Our findings establish KV caches as a free, effective substrate for sampling and reasoning, opening new directions for representation reuse in LLM inference.

### SAPO: Self-Adaptive Process Optimization Makes Small Reasoners Stronger

2026/01/28 07:04 GTM

Existing self-evolution methods overlook the influence of fine-grained reasoning steps, which leads to the reasoner-verifier gap. The computational inefficiency of Monte Carlo (MC) process supervision further exacerbates the difficulty in mitigating the gap. Motivated by the Error-Related Negativity (ERN), which the reasoner can localize error following incorrect decisions, guiding rapid adjustments, we propose a Self-Adaptive Process Optimization (SAPO) method for self-improvement in Small Language Models (SLMs). SAPO adaptively and efficiently introduces process supervision signals by actively minimizing the reasoner-verifier gap rather than relying on inefficient MC estimations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms most existing self-evolution methods on two challenging task types: mathematics and code. Additionally, to further investigate SAPO's impact on verifier performance, this work introduces two new benchmarks for process reward models in both mathematical and coding tasks.

### MiLorE-SSL: Scaling Multilingual Capabilities in Self-Supervised Models without Forgetting
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20300v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20300v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20300v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20300v1)

2026/01/28 06:48 GTM

Self-supervised learning (SSL) has greatly advanced speech representation learning, but multilingual SSL models remain constrained to languages encountered during pretraining. Retraining from scratch to incorporate new languages is computationally expensive, while sequential training without migitation strategies often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose MiLorE-SSL, a lightweight framework that combines LoRA modules with a soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism for efficient continual multilingual training. LoRA provides efficient low-rank adaptation, while soft MoE promotes flexible expert sharing across languages, reducing cross-lingual interference. To further mitigate forgetting, we introduce limited replay data from existing languages, avoiding reliance on large historical corpora. Experiments on ML-SUPERB demonstrate that MiLorE-SSL achieves strong performance in new languages and improves the ability in existing ones with only 2.14% trainable parameters.

### Truthfulness Despite Weak Supervision: Evaluating and Training LLMs Using Peer Prediction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20299v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20299v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20299v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20299v1)

The evaluation and post-training of large language models (LLMs) rely on supervision, but strong supervision for difficult tasks is often unavailable, especially when evaluating frontier models. In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.

### One Word is Enough: Minimal Adversarial Perturbations for Neural Text Ranking

Neural ranking models (NRMs) achieve strong retrieval effectiveness, yet prior work has shown they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We revisit this robustness question with a minimal, query-aware attack that promotes a target document by inserting or substituting a single, semantically aligned word - the query center. We study heuristic and gradient-guided variants, including a white-box method that identifies influential insertion points. On TREC-DL 2019/2020 with BERT and monoT5 re-rankers, our single-word attacks achieve up to 91% success while modifying fewer than two tokens per document on average, achieving competitive rank and score boosts with far fewer edits under a comparable white-box setup to ensure fair evaluation against PRADA. We also introduce new diagnostic metrics to analyze attack sensitivity beyond aggregate success rates. Our analysis reveals a Goldilocks zone in which mid-ranked documents are most vulnerable. These findings demonstrate practical risks and motivate future defenses for robust neural ranking.

### Beyond the Needle's Illusion: Decoupled Evaluation of Evidence Access and Use under Semantic Interference at 326M-Token Scale
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20276v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20276v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20276v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20276v1)

Long-context LLM agents must access the right evidence from large environments and use it faithfully. However, the popular Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluation mostly measures benign span localization. The needle is near-unique, and the haystack is largely irrelevant. We introduce EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial NIAH-style benchmark built on a 326M-token MemoryBank. While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap. Systems that saturate benign NIAH degrade sharply in evidence access under semantic interference. These results indicate that semantic discrimination, not context length alone, is the dominant bottleneck for long-context memory at scale.

### RusLICA: A Russian-Language Platform for Automated Linguistic Inquiry and Category Analysis

Defining psycholinguistic characteristics in written texts is a task gaining increasing attention from researchers. One of the most widely used tools in the current field is Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) that originally was developed to analyze English texts and translated into multiple languages. Our approach offers the adaptation of LIWC methodology for the Russian language, considering its grammatical and cultural specificities. The suggested approach comprises 96 categories, integrating syntactic, morphological, lexical, general statistical features, and results of predictions obtained using pre-trained language models (LMs) for text analysis. Rather than applying direct translation to existing thesauri, we built the dictionary specifically for the Russian language based on the content from several lexicographic resources, semantic dictionaries and corpora. The paper describes the process of mapping lemmas to 42 psycholinguistic categories and the implementation of the analyzer as part of RusLICA web service.

### End-to-end example-based sim-to-real RL policy transfer based on neural stylisation with application to robotic cutting

Whereas reinforcement learning has been applied with success to a range of robotic control problems in complex, uncertain environments, reliance on extensive data - typically sourced from simulation environments - limits real-world deployment due to the domain gap between simulated and physical systems, coupled with limited real-world sample availability. We propose a novel method for sim-to-real transfer of reinforcement learning policies, based on a reinterpretation of neural style transfer from image processing to synthesise novel training data from unpaired unlabelled real world datasets. We employ a variational autoencoder to jointly learn self-supervised feature representations for style transfer and generate weakly paired source-target trajectories to improve physical realism of synthesised trajectories. We demonstrate the application of our approach based on the case study of robot cutting of unknown materials. Compared to baseline methods, including our previous work, CycleGAN, and conditional variational autoencoder-based time series translation, our approach achieves improved task completion time and behavioural stability with minimal real-world data. Our framework demonstrates robustness to geometric and material variation, and highlights the feasibility of policy adaptation in challenging contact-rich tasks where real-world reward information is unavailable.

### MemCtrl: Using MLLMs as Active Memory Controllers on Embodied Agents

Foundation models rely on in-context learning for personalized decision making. The limited size of this context window necessitates memory compression and retrieval systems like RAG. These systems however often treat memory as large offline storage spaces, which is unfavorable for embodied agents that are expected to operate under strict memory and compute constraints, online. In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online. MemCtrl augments MLLMs with a trainable memory head μthat acts as a gate to determine which observations or reflections to retain, update, or discard during exploration. We evaluate with training two types of μ, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on μ-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that μ-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by μ, noting the superior performance of μaugmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.

### A Methodology for Designing Knowledge-Driven Missions for Robots

This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for implementing knowledge graphs in ROS 2 systems, aiming to enhance the efficiency and intelligence of autonomous robotic missions. The methodology encompasses several key steps: defining initial and target conditions, structuring tasks and subtasks, planning their sequence, representing task-related data in a knowledge graph, and designing the mission using a high-level language. Each step builds on the previous one to ensure a cohesive process from initial setup to final execution. A practical implementation within the Aerostack2 framework is demonstrated through a simulated search and rescue mission in a Gazebo environment, where drones autonomously locate a target. This implementation highlights the effectiveness of the methodology in improving decision-making and mission performance by leveraging knowledge graphs.

### Learning From a Steady Hand: A Weakly Supervised Agent for Robot Assistance under Microscopy
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20776v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20776v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20776v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20776v1)

This paper rethinks steady-hand robotic manipulation by using a weakly supervised framework that fuses calibration-aware perception with admittance control. Unlike conventional automation that relies on labor-intensive 2D labeling, our framework leverages reusable warm-up trajectories to extract implicit spatial information, thereby achieving calibration-aware, depth-resolved perception without the need for external fiducials or manual depth annotation. By explicitly characterizing residuals from observation and calibration models, the system establishes a task-space error budget from recorded warm-ups. The uncertainty budget yields a lateral closed-loop accuracy of approx. 49 micrometers at 95% confidence (worst-case testing subset) and a depth accuracy of <= 291 micrometers at 95% confidence bound during large in-plane moves. In a within-subject user study (N=8), the learned agent reduces overall NASA-TLX workload by 77.1% relative to the simple steady-hand assistance baseline. These results demonstrate that the weakly supervised agent improves the reliability of microscope-guided biomedical micromanipulation without introducing complex setup requirements, offering a practical framework for microscope-guided intervention.

### Li-ViP3D++: Query-Gated Deformable Camera-LiDAR Fusion for End-to-End Perception and Trajectory Prediction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20720v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20720v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20720v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20720v1)

2026/01/28 15:53 GTM

End-to-end perception and trajectory prediction from raw sensor data is one of the key capabilities for autonomous driving. Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.

### One Step Is Enough: Dispersive MeanFlow Policy Optimization

Real-time robotic control demands fast action generation. However, existing generative policies based on diffusion and flow matching require multi-step
  sampling, fundamentally limiting deployment in time-critical scenarios. We propose Dispersive MeanFlow Policy Optimization (DMPO), a unified framework that
  enables true one-step generation through three key components: MeanFlow for mathematically-derived single-step inference without knowledge distillation,
  dispersive regularization to prevent representation collapse, and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning to surpass expert demonstrations. Experiments
  across RoboMimic manipulation and OpenAI Gym locomotion benchmarks demonstrate competitive or superior performance compared to multi-step baselines. With
  our lightweight model architecture and the three key algorithmic components working in synergy, DMPO exceeds real-time control requirements (>120Hz) with
  5-20x inference speedup, reaching hundreds of Hertz on high-performance GPUs. Physical deployment on a Franka-Emika-Panda robot validates real-world
  applicability.

### Tendon-based modelling, estimation and control for a simulated high-DoF anthropomorphic hand model
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20682v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20682v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20682v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20682v1)

Tendon-driven anthropomorphic robotic hands often lack direct joint angle sensing, as the integration of joint encoders can compromise mechanical compactness and dexterity. This paper presents a computational method for estimating joint positions from measured tendon displacements and tensions. An efficient kinematic modeling framework for anthropomorphic hands is first introduced based on the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. Using a simplified tendon model, a system of nonlinear equations relating tendon states to joint positions is derived and solved via a nonlinear optimization approach. The estimated joint angles are then employed for closed-loop control through a Jacobian-based proportional-integral (PI) controller augmented with a feedforward term, enabling gesture tracking without direct joint sensing. The effectiveness and limitations of the proposed estimation and control framework are demonstrated in the MuJoCo simulation environment using the Anatomically Correct Biomechatronic Hand, featuring five degrees of freedom for each long finger and six degrees of freedom for the thumb.

### GPO: Growing Policy Optimization for Legged Robot Locomotion and Whole-Body Control
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20668v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20668v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20668v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20668v1)

Training reinforcement learning (RL) policies for legged robots remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous actions, hardware constraints, and limited exploration. Existing methods for locomotion and whole-body control work well for position-based control with environment-specific heuristics (e.g., reward shaping, curriculum design, and manual initialization), but are less effective for torque-based control, where sufficiently exploring the action space and obtaining informative gradient signals for training is significantly more difficult. We introduce Growing Policy Optimization (GPO), a training framework that applies a time-varying action transformation to restrict the effective action space in the early stage, thereby encouraging more effective data collection and policy learning, and then progressively expands it to enhance exploration and achieve higher expected return. We prove that this transformation preserves the PPO update rule and introduces only bounded, vanishing gradient distortion, thereby ensuring stable training. We evaluate GPO on both quadruped and hexapod robots, including zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on hardware. Policies trained with GPO consistently achieve better performance. These results suggest that GPO provides a general, environment-agnostic optimization framework for learning legged locomotion.

### MeCo: Enhancing LLM-Empowered Multi-Robot Collaboration via Similar Task Memoization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20577v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20577v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20577v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20577v1)

Multi-robot systems have been widely deployed in real-world applications, providing significant improvements in efficiency and reductions in labor costs. However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

### Vibro-Sense: Robust Vibration-based Impulse Response Localization and Trajectory Tracking for Robotic Hands

Rich contact perception is crucial for robotic manipulation, yet traditional tactile skins remain expensive and complex to integrate. This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.

### A Practical Framework of Key Performance Indicators for Multi-Robot Lunar and Planetary Field Tests

Robotic prospecting for critical resources on the Moon, such as ilmenite, rare earth elements, and water ice, requires robust exploration methods given the diverse terrain and harsh environmental conditions. Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments. Overall, we propose this framework as a common evaluation standard enabling consistent, goal-oriented comparison of multi-robot field trials and supporting systematic development of robotic systems for future planetary exploration.

### STORM: Slot-based Task-aware Object-centric Representation for robotic Manipulation

Visual foundation models provide strong perceptual features for robotics, but their dense representations lack explicit object-level structure, limiting robustness and contractility in manipulation tasks. We propose STORM (Slot-based Task-aware Object-centric Representation for robotic Manipulation), a lightweight object-centric adaptation module that augments frozen visual foundation models with a small set of semantic-aware slots for robotic manipulation. Rather than retraining large backbones, STORM employs a multi-phase training strategy: object-centric slots are first stabilized through visual--semantic pretraining using language embeddings, then jointly adapted with a downstream manipulation policy. This staged learning prevents degenerate slot formation and preserves semantic consistency while aligning perception with task objectives. Experiments on object discovery benchmarks and simulated manipulation tasks show that STORM improves generalization to visual distractors, and control performance compared to directly using frozen foundation model features or training object-centric representations end-to-end. Our results highlight multi-phase adaptation as an efficient mechanism for transforming generic foundation model features into task-aware object-centric representations for robotic control.

### RF-MatID: Dataset and Benchmark for Radio Frequency Material Identification

Accurate material identification plays a crucial role in embodied AI systems, enabling a wide range of applications. However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and geometry-diverse RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates controlled geometry perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance. We further establish a multi-setting, multi-protocol benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models, assessing both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness under cross-angle and cross-distance shifts. The 5 frequency-allocation protocols enable systematic frequency- and region-level analysis, thereby facilitating real-world deployment. RF-MatID aims to enable reproducible research, accelerate algorithmic advancement, foster cross-domain robustness, and support the development of real-world application in RF-based material identification.

### Demonstration-Free Robotic Control via LLM Agents

Robotic manipulation has increasingly adopted vision-language-action (VLA) models, which achieve strong performance but typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning, and often generalize poorly under domain shift. We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

### Tactile-Force Alignment in Vision-Language-Action Models for Force-aware Manipulation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20321v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20321v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20321v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.20321v1)

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful generalists for robotic manipulation. However, due to their predominant reliance on visual modalities, they fundamentally lack the physical intuition required for contact-rich tasks that require precise force regulation and physical reasoning. Existing attempts to incorporate vision-based tactile sensing into VLA models typically treat tactile inputs as auxiliary visual textures, thereby overlooking the underlying correlation between surface deformation and interaction dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm shift from tactile-vision alignment to tactile-force alignment. Here, we introduce TaF-VLA, a framework that explicitly grounds high-dimensional tactile observations in physical interaction forces. To facilitate this, we develop an automated tactile-force data acquisition device and curate the TaF-Dataset, comprising over 10 million synchronized tactile observations, 6-axis force/torque, and matrix force map. To align sequential tactile observations with interaction forces, the central component of our approach is the Tactile-Force Adapter (TaF-Adapter), a tactile sensor encoder that extracts discretized latent information for encoding tactile observations. This mechanism ensures that the learned representations capture history-dependent, noise-insensitive physical dynamics rather than static visual textures. Finally, we integrate this force-aligned encoder into a VLA backbone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that TaF-VLA policy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tactile-vision-aligned and vision-only baselines on contact-rich tasks, verifying its ability to achieve robust, force-aware manipulation through cross-modal physical reasoning.
