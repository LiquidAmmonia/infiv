### MemFlow: Flowing Adaptive Memory for Consistent and Efficient Long Video Narratives
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14699v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14699v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14699v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14699v1)

The core challenge for streaming video generation is maintaining the content consistency in long context, which poses high requirement for the memory design. Most existing solutions maintain the memory by compressing historical frames with predefined strategies. However, different to-generate video chunks should refer to different historical cues, which is hard to satisfy with fixed strategies. In this work, we propose MemFlow to address this problem. Specifically, before generating the coming chunk, we dynamically update the memory bank by retrieving the most relevant historical frames with the text prompt of this chunk. This design enables narrative coherence even if new event happens or scenario switches in future frames. In addition, during generation, we only activate the most relevant tokens in the memory bank for each query in the attention layers, which effectively guarantees the generation efficiency. In this way, MemFlow achieves outstanding long-context consistency with negligible computation burden (7.9% speed reduction compared with the memory-free baseline) and keeps the compatibility with any streaming video generation model with KV cache.

### TimeLens: Rethinking Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14698v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14698v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14698v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14698v1)

This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

### Spherical Leech Quantization for Visual Tokenization and Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14697v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14697v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14697v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14697v1)

Non-parametric quantization has received much attention due to its efficiency on parameters and scalability to a large codebook. In this paper, we present a unified formulation of different non-parametric quantization methods through the lens of lattice coding. The geometry of lattice codes explains the necessity of auxiliary loss terms when training auto-encoders with certain existing lookup-free quantization variants such as BSQ. As a step forward, we explore a few possible candidates, including random lattices, generalized Fibonacci lattices, and densest sphere packing lattices. Among all, we find the Leech lattice-based quantization method, which is dubbed as Spherical Leech Quantization ($Λ_{24}$-SQ), leads to both a simplified training recipe and an improved reconstruction-compression tradeoff thanks to its high symmetry and even distribution on the hypersphere. In image tokenization and compression tasks, this quantization approach achieves better reconstruction quality across all metrics than BSQ, the best prior art, while consuming slightly fewer bits. The improvement also extends to state-of-the-art auto-regressive image generation frameworks.

### CRISP: Contact-Guided Real2Sim from Monocular Video with Planar Scene Primitives
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14696v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14696v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14696v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14696v1)

2025/12/16 18:59 GTM

We introduce CRISP, a method that recovers simulatable human motion and scene geometry from monocular video. Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\% to 6.9\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos. This demonstrates CRISP's ability to generate physically-valid human motion and interaction environments at scale, greatly advancing real-to-sim applications for robotics and AR/VR.

### Native and Compact Structured Latents for 3D Generation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14692v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14692v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14692v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14692v1)

Recent advancements in 3D generative modeling have significantly improved the generation realism, yet the field is still hampered by existing representations, which struggle to capture assets with complex topologies and detailed appearance. This paper present an approach for learning a structured latent representation from native 3D data to address this challenge. At its core is a new sparse voxel structure called O-Voxel, an omni-voxel representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. O-Voxel can robustly model arbitrary topology, including open, non-manifold, and fully-enclosed surfaces, while capturing comprehensive surface attributes beyond texture color, such as physically-based rendering parameters. Based on O-Voxel, we design a Sparse Compression VAE which provides a high spatial compression rate and a compact latent space. We train large-scale flow-matching models comprising 4B parameters for 3D generation using diverse public 3D asset datasets. Despite their scale, inference remains highly efficient. Meanwhile, the geometry and material quality of our generated assets far exceed those of existing models. We believe our approach offers a significant advancement in 3D generative modeling.

### MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14691v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14691v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14691v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14691v1)

Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.

### VASA-3D: Lifelike Audio-Driven Gaussian Head Avatars from a Single Image
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14677v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14677v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14677v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14677v1)

2025/12/16 18:44 GTM

We propose VASA-3D, an audio-driven, single-shot 3D head avatar generator. This research tackles two major challenges: capturing the subtle expression details present in real human faces, and reconstructing an intricate 3D head avatar from a single portrait image. To accurately model expression details, VASA-3D leverages the motion latent of VASA-1, a method that yields exceptional realism and vividness in 2D talking heads. A critical element of our work is translating this motion latent to 3D, which is accomplished by devising a 3D head model that is conditioned on the motion latent. Customization of this model to a single image is achieved through an optimization framework that employs numerous video frames of the reference head synthesized from the input image. The optimization takes various training losses robust to artifacts and limited pose coverage in the generated training data. Our experiment shows that VASA-3D produces realistic 3D talking heads that cannot be achieved by prior art, and it supports the online generation of 512x512 free-viewpoint videos at up to 75 FPS, facilitating more immersive engagements with lifelike 3D avatars.

### ART: Articulated Reconstruction Transformer
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14671v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14671v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14671v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14671v1)

2025/12/16 18:35 GTM

We introduce ART, Articulated Reconstruction Transformer -- a category-agnostic, feed-forward model that reconstructs complete 3D articulated objects from only sparse, multi-state RGB images. Previous methods for articulated object reconstruction either rely on slow optimization with fragile cross-state correspondences or use feed-forward models limited to specific object categories. In contrast, ART treats articulated objects as assemblies of rigid parts, formulating reconstruction as part-based prediction. Our newly designed transformer architecture maps sparse image inputs to a set of learnable part slots, from which ART jointly decodes unified representations for individual parts, including their 3D geometry, texture, and explicit articulation parameters. The resulting reconstructions are physically interpretable and readily exportable for simulation. Trained on a large-scale, diverse dataset with per-part supervision, and evaluated across diverse benchmarks, ART achieves significant improvements over existing baselines and establishes a new state of the art for articulated object reconstruction from image inputs.

### EVOLVE-VLA: Test-Time Training from Environment Feedback for Vision-Language-Action Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14666v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14666v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14666v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14666v1)

2025/12/16 18:26 GTM

Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.

### Enhancing Visual Sentiment Analysis via Semiotic Isotopy-Guided Dataset Construction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14665v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14665v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14665v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14665v1)

2025/12/16 18:26 GTM

Visual Sentiment Analysis (VSA) is a challenging task due to the vast diversity of emotionally salient images and the inherent difficulty of acquiring sufficient data to capture this variability comprehensively. Key obstacles include building large-scale VSA datasets and developing effective methodologies that enable algorithms to identify emotionally significant elements within an image. These challenges are reflected in the limited generalization performance of VSA algorithms and models when trained and tested across different datasets. Starting from a pool of existing data collections, our approach enables the creation of a new larger dataset that not only contains a wider variety of images than the original ones, but also permits training new models with improved capability to focus on emotionally relevant combinations of image elements. This is achieved through the integration of the semiotic isotopy concept within the dataset creation process, providing deeper insights into the emotional content of images. Empirical evaluations show that models trained on a dataset generated with our method consistently outperform those trained on the original data collections, achieving superior generalization across major VSA benchmarks

### WaveSim: A Wavelet-based Multi-scale Similarity Metric for Weather and Climate Fields
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14656v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14656v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14656v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14656v1)

2025/12/16 18:15 GTM

We introduce WaveSim, a multi-scale similarity metric for the evaluation of spatial fields in weather and climate applications. WaveSim exploits wavelet transforms to decompose input fields into scale-specific wavelet coefficients. The metric is built by multiplying three orthogonal components derived from these coefficients: Magnitude, which quantifies similarities in the energy distribution of the coefficients, i.e., the intensity of the field; Displacement, which captures spatial shift by comparing the centers of mass of normalized energy distributions; and Structure, which assesses pattern organization independent of location and amplitude. Each component yields a scale-specific similarity score ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (perfect similarity), which are then combined across scales to produce an overall similarity measure. We first evaluate WaveSim using synthetic test cases, applying controlled spatial and temporal perturbations to systematically assess its sensitivity and expected behavior. We then demonstrate its applicability to physically relevant case studies of key modes of climate variability in Earth System Models. Traditional point-wise metrics lack a mechanism for attributing errors to physical scales or modes of dissimilarity. By operating in the wavelet domain and decomposing the signal along independent axes, WaveSim bypasses these limitations and provides an interpretable and diagnostically rich framework for assessing similarity in complex fields. Additionally, the WaveSim framework allows users to place emphasis on a specific scale or component, and lends itself to user-specific model intercomparison, model evaluation, and calibration and training of forecasting systems. We provide a PyTorch-ready implementation of WaveSim, along with all evaluation scripts, at: https://github.com/gabrieleaccarino/wavesim.

### ViRC: Enhancing Visual Interleaved Mathematical CoT with Reason Chunking
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14654v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14654v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14654v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14654v1)

2025/12/16 18:13 GTM

CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Leon-LihongWang/ViRC.

### Adaptable Segmentation Pipeline for Diverse Brain Tumors with Radiomic-guided Subtyping and Lesion-Wise Model Ensemble
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14648v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14648v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14648v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14648v1)

2025/12/16 18:09 GTM

Robust and generalizable segmentation of brain tumors on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains difficult because tumor types differ widely. The BraTS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge benchmarks segmentation methods on diverse high-quality datasets of adult and pediatric tumors: multi-consortium international pediatric brain tumor segmentation (PED), preoperative meningioma tumor segmentation (MEN), meningioma radiotherapy segmentation (MEN-RT), and segmentation of pre- and post-treatment brain metastases (MET). We present a flexible, modular, and adaptable pipeline that improves segmentation performance by selecting and combining state-of-the-art models and applying tumor- and lesion-specific processing before and after training. Radiomic features extracted from MRI help detect tumor subtype, ensuring a more balanced training. Custom lesion-level performance metrics determine the influence of each model in the ensemble and optimize post-processing that further refines the predictions, enabling the workflow to tailor every step to each case. On the BraTS testing sets, our pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple challenges. These findings confirm that custom lesion-aware processing and model selection yield robust segmentations yet without locking the method to a specific network architecture. Our method has the potential for quantitative tumor measurement in clinical practice, supporting diagnosis and prognosis.

### A Multicenter Benchmark of Multiple Instance Learning Models for Lymphoma Subtyping from HE-stained Whole Slide Images
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14640v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14640v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14640v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14640v1)

Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.

### AMD-HookNet++: Evolution of AMD-HookNet with Hybrid CNN-Transformer Feature Enhancement for Glacier Calving Front Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14639v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14639v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14639v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14639v1)

2025/12/16 17:57 GTM

The dynamics of glaciers and ice shelf fronts significantly impact the mass balance of ice sheets and coastal sea levels. To effectively monitor glacier conditions, it is crucial to consistently estimate positional shifts of glacier calving fronts. AMD-HookNet firstly introduces a pure two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) for glacier segmentation. Yet, the local nature and translational invariance of convolution operations, while beneficial for capturing low-level details, restricts the model ability to maintain long-range dependencies. In this study, we propose AMD-HookNet++, a novel advanced hybrid CNN-Transformer feature enhancement method for segmenting glaciers and delineating calving fronts in synthetic aperture radar images. Our hybrid structure consists of two branches: a Transformer-based context branch to capture long-range dependencies, which provides global contextual information in a larger view, and a CNN-based target branch to preserve local details. To strengthen the representation of the connected hybrid features, we devise an enhanced spatial-channel attention module to foster interactions between the hybrid CNN-Transformer branches through dynamically adjusting the token relationships from both spatial and channel perspectives. Additionally, we develop a pixel-to-pixel contrastive deep supervision to optimize our hybrid model by integrating pixelwise metric learning into glacier segmentation. Through extensive experiments and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on the challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe, we show that AMD-HookNet++ sets a new state of the art with an IoU of 78.2 and a HD95 of 1,318 m, while maintaining a competitive MDE of 367 m. More importantly, our hybrid model produces smoother delineations of calving fronts, resolving the issue of jagged edges typically seen in pure Transformer-based approaches.

### Distill Video Datasets into Images
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14621v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14621v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14621v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14621v1)

Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets that allow models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to training on the full dataset. While this approach has shown promising results for image data, extending dataset distillation methods to video data has proven challenging and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we first identify the core challenge in video set distillation as the substantial increase in learnable parameters introduced by the temporal dimension of video, which complicates optimization and hinders convergence. To address this issue, we observe that a single frame is often sufficient to capture the discriminative semantics of a video. Leveraging this insight, we propose Single-Frame Video set Distillation (SFVD), a framework that distills videos into highly informative frames for each class. Using differentiable interpolation, these frames are transformed into video sequences and matched with the original dataset, while updates are restricted to the frames themselves for improved optimization efficiency. To further incorporate temporal information, the distilled frames are combined with sampled real videos from real videos during the matching process through a channel reshaping layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SFVD substantially outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to 5.3% on MiniUCF, thereby offering a more effective solution.

### JMMMU-Pro: Image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark via Vibe Benchmark Construction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14620v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14620v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14620v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14620v1)

2025/12/16 17:33 GTM

This paper introduces JMMMU-Pro, an image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark, and Vibe Benchmark Construction, a scalable construction method. Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.

### WorldPlay: Towards Long-Term Geometric Consistency for Real-Time Interactive World Modeling
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14614v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14614v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14614v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14614v1)

2025/12/16 17:22 GTM

This paper presents WorldPlay, a streaming video diffusion model that enables real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency, resolving the trade-off between speed and memory that limits current methods. WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

### FakeRadar: Probing Forgery Outliers to Detect Unknown Deepfake Videos
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14601v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14601v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14601v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14601v1)

2025/12/16 17:11 GTM

In this paper, we propose FakeRadar, a novel deepfake video detection framework designed to address the challenges of cross-domain generalization in real-world scenarios. Existing detection methods typically rely on manipulation-specific cues, performing well on known forgery types but exhibiting severe limitations against emerging manipulation techniques. This poor generalization stems from their inability to adapt effectively to unseen forgery patterns. To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses. Experiments show that FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly in cross-domain evaluations, by handling the variety of emerging manipulation techniques.

### TUMTraf EMOT: Event-Based Multi-Object Tracking Dataset and Baseline for Traffic Scenarios
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14595v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14595v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14595v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14595v1)

In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), multi-object tracking is primarily based on frame-based cameras. However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance.

### LLM-driven Knowledge Enhancement for Multimodal Cancer Survival Prediction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14594v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14594v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14594v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14594v1)

Current multimodal survival prediction methods typically rely on pathology images (WSIs) and genomic data, both of which are high-dimensional and redundant, making it difficult to extract discriminative features from them and align different modalities. Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that KEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.

### FoodLogAthl-218: Constructing a Real-World Food Image Dataset Using Dietary Management Applications
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14574v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14574v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14574v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14574v1)

Food image classification models are crucial for dietary management applications because they reduce the burden of manual meal logging. However, most publicly available datasets for training such models rely on web-crawled images, which often differ from users' real-world meal photos. In this work, we present FoodLogAthl-218, a food image dataset constructed from real-world meal records collected through the dietary management application FoodLog Athl. The dataset contains 6,925 images across 218 food categories, with a total of 14,349 bounding boxes. Rich metadata, including meal date and time, anonymized user IDs, and meal-level context, accompany each image. Unlike conventional datasets-where a predefined class set guides web-based image collection-our data begins with user-submitted photos, and labels are applied afterward. This yields greater intra-class diversity, a natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual, unfiltered images intended for personal use rather than public sharing. In addition to (1) a standard classification benchmark, we introduce two FoodLog-specific tasks: (2) an incremental fine-tuning protocol that follows the temporal stream of users' logs, and (3) a context-aware classification task where each image contains multiple dishes, and the model must classify each dish by leveraging the overall meal context. We evaluate these tasks using large multimodal models (LMMs). The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/FoodLog/FoodLogAthl-218.

### CLNet: Cross-View Correspondence Makes a Stronger Geo-Localizationer
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14560v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14560v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14560v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14560v1)

2025/12/16 16:31 GTM

Image retrieval-based cross-view geo-localization (IRCVGL) aims to match images captured from significantly different viewpoints, such as satellite and street-level images. Existing methods predominantly rely on learning robust global representations or implicit feature alignment, which often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences crucial for accurate localization. In this work, we propose a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework, termed CLNet, that explicitly bridges the semantic and geometric gaps between different views. CLNet decomposes the view alignment process into three learnable and complementary modules: a Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields; a Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using an MLP-based transformation; and a Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) module that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues. The proposed CLNet can jointly capture both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and University-1652, demonstrate that our proposed CLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering better interpretability and generalizability.

### Test Time Optimized Generalized AI-based Medical Image Registration Method
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14556v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14556v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14556v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14556v1)

2025/12/16 16:29 GTM

Medical image registration is critical for aligning anatomical structures across imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. Among existing techniques, non-rigid registration (NRR) is particularly challenging due to the need to capture complex anatomical deformations caused by physiological processes like respiration or contrast-induced signal variations. Traditional NRR methods, while theoretically robust, often require extensive parameter tuning and incur high computational costs, limiting their use in real-time clinical workflows. Recent deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise; however, their dependence on task-specific retraining restricts scalability and adaptability in practice. These limitations underscore the need for efficient, generalizable registration frameworks capable of handling heterogeneous imaging contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for 3D non-rigid registration that generalizes across multiple imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Unlike conventional methods that rely on application-specific models, our approach eliminates anatomy- or modality-specific customization, enabling streamlined integration into diverse clinical environments.

### TAT: Task-Adaptive Transformer for All-in-One Medical Image Restoration
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14550v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14550v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14550v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14550v1)

2025/12/16 16:25 GTM

Medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to recover high-quality medical images from their low-quality counterparts. Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using a shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose a task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, a task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, a task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks--PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution--both in task-specific and All-in-One settings. Code is available at https://github.com/Yaziwel/TAT.

### HiFi-Portrait: Zero-shot Identity-preserved Portrait Generation with High-fidelity Multi-face Fusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14542v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14542v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14542v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14542v1)

2025/12/16 16:17 GTM

Recent advancements in diffusion-based technologies have made significant strides, particularly in identity-preserved portrait generation (IPG). However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability. Furthermore, our method is also compatible with previous SDXL-based works.

### CAPRMIL: Context-Aware Patch Representations for Multiple Instance Learning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14540v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14540v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14540v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14540v1)

2025/12/16 16:16 GTM

In computational pathology, weak supervision has become the standard for deep learning due to the gigapixel scale of WSIs and the scarcity of pixel-level annotations, with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) established as the principal framework for slide-level model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time. Our results indicate that learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis. Our code is available at https://github.com/mandlos/CAPRMIL

### DASP: Self-supervised Nighttime Monocular Depth Estimation with Domain Adaptation of Spatiotemporal Priors
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14536v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14536v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14536v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14536v1)

2025/12/16 16:11 GTM

Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved notable success under daytime conditions. However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

### Native Intelligence Emerges from Large-Scale Clinical Practice: A Retinal Foundation Model with Deployment Efficiency
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14499v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14499v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14499v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14499v1)

2025/12/16 15:33 GTM

Current retinal foundation models remain constrained by curated research datasets that lack authentic clinical context, and require extensive task-specific optimization for each application, limiting their deployment efficiency in low-resource settings. Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels. These results demonstrate that clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without any further annotation to build medical AI systems suited to various low-resource settings.

### SignIT: A Comprehensive Dataset and Multimodal Analysis for Italian Sign Language Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14489v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14489v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14489v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14489v1)

2025/12/16 15:21 GTM

In this work we present SignIT, a new dataset to study the task of Italian Sign Language (LIS) recognition. The dataset is composed of 644 videos covering 3.33 hours. We manually annotated videos considering a taxonomy of 94 distinct sign classes belonging to 5 macro-categories: Animals, Food, Colors, Emotions and Family. We also extracted 2D keypoints related to the hands, face and body of the users. With the dataset, we propose a benchmark for the sign recognition task, adopting several state-of-the-art models showing how temporal information, 2D keypoints and RGB frames can be influence the performance of these models. Results show the limitations of these models on this challenging LIS dataset. We release data and annotations at the following link: https://fpv-iplab.github.io/SignIT/.

### SuperCLIP: CLIP with Simple Classification Supervision
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14480v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14480v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14480v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14480v1)

2025/12/16 15:11 GTM

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) achieves strong generalization in vision-language tasks by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. However, recent findings show that CLIP-like models still underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, and this issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with long and detailed captions. This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment. To address this, we propose SuperCLIP, a simple yet effective framework that augments contrastive learning with classification-based supervision. By adding only a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder, SuperCLIP leverages token-level cues to enhance visual-textual alignment - with just a 0.077% increase in total FLOPs, and no need for additional annotated data. Experiments show that SuperCLIP consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and purely visual tasks. These gains hold regardless of whether the model is trained on original web data or rich re-captioned data, demonstrating SuperCLIP's ability to recover textual supervision in both cases. Furthermore, SuperCLIP alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop through classification-based supervision that avoids reliance on large batch sizes. Code and models will be made open source.

### TACK Tunnel Data (TTD): A Benchmark Dataset for Deep Learning-Based Defect Detection in Tunnels
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14477v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14477v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14477v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14477v1)

Tunnels are essential elements of transportation infrastructure, but are increasingly affected by ageing and deterioration mechanisms such as cracking. Regular inspections are required to ensure their safety, yet traditional manual procedures are time-consuming, subjective, and costly. Recent advances in mobile mapping systems and Deep Learning (DL) enable automated visual inspections. However, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of tunnel datasets. This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset containing annotated images of three different tunnel linings, capturing typical defects: cracks, leaching, and water infiltration. The dataset is designed to support supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised DL methods for defect detection and segmentation. Its diversity in texture and construction techniques also enables investigation of model generalization and transferability across tunnel types. By addressing the critical lack of domain-specific data, this dataset contributes to advancing automated tunnel inspection and promoting safer, more efficient infrastructure maintenance strategies.

### A4-Agent: An Agentic Framework for Zero-Shot Affordance Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14442v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14442v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14442v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14442v1)

2025/12/16 14:27 GTM

Affordance prediction, which identifies interaction regions on objects based on language instructions, is critical for embodied AI. Prevailing end-to-end models couple high-level reasoning and low-level grounding into a single monolithic pipeline and rely on training over annotated datasets, which leads to poor generalization on novel objects and unseen environments. In this paper, we move beyond this paradigm by proposing A4-Agent, a training-free agentic framework that decouples affordance prediction into a three-stage pipeline. Our framework coordinates specialized foundation models at test time: (1) a $\textbf{Dreamer}$ that employs generative models to visualize $\textit{how}$ an interaction would look; (2) a $\textbf{Thinker}$ that utilizes large vision-language models to decide $\textit{what}$ object part to interact with; and (3) a $\textbf{Spotter}$ that orchestrates vision foundation models to precisely locate $\textit{where}$ the interaction area is. By leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained models without any task-specific fine-tuning, our zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings.

### S2D: Sparse-To-Dense Keymask Distillation for Unsupervised Video Instance Segmentation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14440v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14440v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14440v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14440v1)

2025/12/16 14:26 GTM

In recent years, the state-of-the-art in unsupervised video instance segmentation has heavily relied on synthetic video data, generated from object-centric image datasets such as ImageNet. However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss. After training the final model on the resulting dense labelset, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks.

### VICTOR: Dataset Copyright Auditing in Video Recognition Systems

2025/12/16 14:26 GTM

Video recognition systems are increasingly being deployed in daily life, such as content recommendation and security monitoring. To enhance video recognition development, many institutions have released high-quality public datasets with open-source licenses for training advanced models. At the same time, these datasets are also susceptible to misuse and infringement. Dataset copyright auditing is an effective solution to identify such unauthorized use. However, existing dataset copyright solutions primarily focus on the image domain; the complex nature of video data leaves dataset copyright auditing in the video domain unexplored. Specifically, video data introduces an additional temporal dimension, which poses significant challenges to the effectiveness and stealthiness of existing methods.
  In this paper, we propose VICTOR, the first dataset copyright auditing approach for video recognition systems. We develop a general and stealthy sample modification strategy that enhances the output discrepancy of the target model. By modifying only a small proportion of samples (e.g., 1%), VICTOR amplifies the impact of published modified samples on the prediction behavior of the target models. Then, the difference in the model's behavior for published modified and unpublished original samples can serve as a key basis for dataset auditing. Extensive experiments on multiple models and datasets highlight the superiority of VICTOR. Finally, we show that VICTOR is robust in the presence of several perturbation mechanisms to the training videos or the target models.

### Score-Based Turbo Message Passing for Plug-and-Play Compressive Imaging
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14435v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14435v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14435v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14435v1)

2025/12/16 14:24 GTM

Message-passing algorithms have been adapted for compressive imaging by incorporating various off-the-shelf image denoisers. However, these denoisers rely largely on generic or hand-crafted priors and often fall short in accurately capturing the complex statistical structure of natural images. As a result, traditional plug-and-play (PnP) methods often lead to suboptimal reconstruction, especially in highly underdetermined regimes. Recently, score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for accurately characterizing sophisticated image distribution. Yet, their direct use for posterior sampling typically incurs prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the close connection between score-based generative modeling and empirical Bayes denoising, we devise a message-passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. The resulting algorithm, named score-based turbo message passing (STMP), combines the fast convergence of message passing with the expressive power of score-based generative priors. For practical systems with quantized measurements, we further propose quantized STMP (Q-STMP), which augments STMP with a component-wise MMSE dequantization module. We demonstrate that the asymptotic performance of STMP and Q-STMP can be accurately predicted by a set of state-evolution (SE) equations. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that STMP strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff compared with competing baselines, and that Q-STMP remains robust even under 1-bit quantization. Remarkably, both STMP and Q-STMP typically converge within 10 iterations.

### The Devil is in Attention Sharing: Improving Complex Non-rigid Image Editing Faithfulness via Attention Synergy
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14423v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14423v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14423v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14423v1)

2025/12/16 14:08 GTM

Training-free image editing with large diffusion models has become practical, yet faithfully performing complex non-rigid edits (e.g., pose or shape changes) remains highly challenging. We identify a key underlying cause: attention collapse in existing attention sharing mechanisms, where either positional embeddings or semantic features dominate visual content retrieval, leading to over-editing or under-editing.To address this issue, we introduce SynPS, a method that Synergistically leverages Positional embeddings and Semantic information for faithful non-rigid image editing. We first propose an editing measurement that quantifies the required editing magnitude at each denoising step. Based on this measurement, we design an attention synergy pipeline that dynamically modulates the influence of positional embeddings, enabling SynPS to balance semantic modifications and fidelity preservation.By adaptively integrating positional and semantic cues, SynPS effectively avoids both over- and under-editing. Extensive experiments on public and newly curated benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and faithfulness of our approach.

### LCMem: A Universal Model for Robust Image Memorization Detection
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14421v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14421v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14421v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14421v1)

2025/12/16 14:06 GTM

Recent advances in generative image modeling have achieved visual realism sufficient to deceive human experts, yet their potential for privacy preserving data sharing remains insufficiently understood. A central obstacle is the absence of reliable memorization detection mechanisms, limited quantitative evaluation, and poor generalization of existing privacy auditing methods across domains. To address this, we propose to view memorization detection as a unified problem at the intersection of re-identification and copy detection, whose complementary goals cover both identity consistency and augmentation-robust duplication, and introduce Latent Contrastive Memorization Network (LCMem), a cross-domain model evaluated jointly on both tasks. LCMem achieves this through a two-stage training strategy that first learns identity consistency before incorporating augmentation-robust copy detection. Across six benchmark datasets, LCMem achieves improvements of up to 16 percentage points on re-identification and 30 percentage points on copy detection, enabling substantially more reliable memorization detection at scale. Our results show that existing privacy filters provide limited performance and robustness, highlighting the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We show that LCMem sets a new standard for cross-domain privacy auditing, offering reliable and scalable memorization detection. Code and model is publicly available at https://github.com/MischaD/LCMem.

### DISCODE: Distribution-Aware Score Decoder for Robust Automatic Evaluation of Image Captioning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14420v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14420v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14420v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14420v1)

2025/12/16 14:06 GTM

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, robust image caption evaluation using LVLMs remains challenging, particularly under domain-shift scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce the Distribution-Aware Score Decoder (DISCODE), a novel finetuning-free method that generates robust evaluation scores better aligned with human judgments across diverse domains. The core idea behind DISCODE lies in its test-time adaptive evaluation approach, which introduces the Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss, leveraging a Gaussian prior distribution to improve robustness in evaluation score estimation. This loss is efficiently minimized at test time using an analytical solution that we derive. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-domain Caption Evaluation (MCEval) benchmark, a new image captioning evaluation benchmark covering six distinct domains, designed to assess the robustness of evaluation metrics. In our experiments, we demonstrate that DISCODE achieves state-of-the-art performance as a reference-free evaluation metric across MCEval and four representative existing benchmarks.

In dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) systems, state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods often fail under significant viewpoint deviations, producing unstable and unrealistic renderings. To address this, we introduce Expanded Dynamic NeRF (ExpanDyNeRF), a monocular NeRF framework that leverages Gaussian splatting priors and a pseudo-ground-truth generation strategy to enable realistic synthesis under large-angle rotations. ExpanDyNeRF optimizes density and color features to improve scene reconstruction from challenging perspectives. We also present the Synthetic Dynamic Multiview (SynDM) dataset, the first synthetic multiview dataset for dynamic scenes with explicit side-view supervision-created using a custom GTA V-based rendering pipeline. Quantitative and qualitative results on SynDM and real-world datasets demonstrate that ExpanDyNeRF significantly outperforms existing dynamic NeRF methods in rendering fidelity under extreme viewpoint shifts. Further details are provided in the supplementary materials.

Climate adaptation is vital for the sustainability and sometimes the mere survival of our urban areas. However, small cities often struggle with limited personnel resources and integrating vast amounts of data from multiple sources for a comprehensive analysis. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-layered system combining specialized LLMs, satellite imagery analysis and a knowledge base to aid in developing effective climate adaptation strategies.

### A Comprehensive Safety Metric to Evaluate Perception in Autonomous Systems

Complete perception of the environment and its correct interpretation is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Object perception is the main component of automotive surround sensing. Various metrics already exist for the evaluation of object perception. However, objects can be of different importance depending on their velocity, orientation, distance, size, or the potential damage that could be caused by a collision due to a missed detection. Thus, these additional parameters have to be considered for safety evaluation. We propose a new safety metric that incorporates all these parameters and returns a single easily interpretable safety assessment score for object perception. This new metric is evaluated with both real world and virtual data sets and compared to state of the art metrics.

### Optimizing Rank for High-Fidelity Implicit Neural Representations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14366v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14366v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14366v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14366v1)

Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) based on vanilla Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are widely believed to be incapable of representing high-frequency content. This has directed research efforts towards architectural interventions, such as coordinate embeddings or specialized activation functions, to represent high-frequency signals. In this paper, we challenge the notion that the low-frequency bias of vanilla MLPs is an intrinsic, architectural limitation to learn high-frequency content, but instead a symptom of stable rank degradation during training. We empirically demonstrate that regulating the network's rank during training substantially improves the fidelity of the learned signal, rendering even simple MLP architectures expressive. Extensive experiments show that using optimizers like Muon, with high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, consistently enhances INR architectures even beyond simple ReLU MLPs. These substantial improvements hold across a diverse range of domains, including natural and medical images, and novel view synthesis, with up to 9 dB PSNR improvements over the previous state-of-the-art.

### Unified Semantic Transformer for 3D Scene Understanding

Holistic 3D scene understanding involves capturing and parsing unstructured 3D environments. Due to the inherent complexity of the real world, existing models have predominantly been developed and limited to be task-specific. We introduce UNITE, a Unified Semantic Transformer for 3D scene understanding, a novel feed-forward neural network that unifies a diverse set of 3D semantic tasks within a single model. Our model operates on unseen scenes in a fully end-to-end manner and only takes a few seconds to infer the full 3D semantic geometry. Our approach is capable of directly predicting multiple semantic attributes, including 3D scene segmentation, instance embeddings, open-vocabulary features, as well as affordance and articulations, solely from RGB images. The method is trained using a combination of 2D distillation, heavily relying on self-supervision and leverages novel multi-view losses designed to ensure 3D view consistency. We demonstrate that UNITE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several different semantic tasks and even outperforms task-specific models, in many cases, surpassing methods that operate on ground truth 3D geometry.

### Mimicking Human Visual Development for Learning Robust Image Representations

The human visual system is remarkably adept at adapting to changes in the input distribution; a capability modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) still struggle to match. Drawing inspiration from the developmental trajectory of human vision, we propose a progressive blurring curriculum to improve the generalization and robustness of CNNs. Human infants are born with poor visual acuity, gradually refining their ability to perceive fine details. Mimicking this process, we begin training CNNs on highly blurred images during the initial epochs and progressively reduce the blur as training advances. This approach encourages the network to prioritize global structures over high-frequency artifacts, improving robustness against distribution shifts and noisy inputs. Challenging prior claims that blurring in the initial training epochs imposes a stimulus deficit and irreversibly harms model performance, we reveal that early-stage blurring enhances generalization with minimal impact on in-domain accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed curriculum reduces mean corruption error (mCE) by up to 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C and 4.43% on ImageNet-100-C datasets, compared to standard training without blurring. Unlike static blur-based augmentation, which applies blurred images randomly throughout training, our method follows a structured progression, yielding consistent gains across various datasets. Furthermore, our approach complements other augmentation techniques, such as CutMix and MixUp, and enhances both natural and adversarial robustness against common attack methods. Code is available at https://github.com/rajankita/Visual_Acuity_Curriculum.

### Enhancing Interpretability for Vision Models via Shapley Value Optimization

Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their decision-making processes remain opaque. Although many explanation methods are dedicated to bringing the obscurity of DNNs to light, they exhibit significant limitations: post-hoc explanation methods often struggle to faithfully reflect model behaviors, while self-explaining neural networks sacrifice performance and compatibility due to their specialized architectural designs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-explaining framework that integrates Shapley value estimation as an auxiliary task during training, which achieves two key advancements: 1) a fair allocation of the model prediction scores to image patches, ensuring explanations inherently align with the model's decision logic, and 2) enhanced interpretability with minor structural modifications, preserving model performance and compatibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art interpretability.

### HGS: Hybrid Gaussian Splatting with Static-Dynamic Decomposition for Compact Dynamic View Synthesis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14352v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14352v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14352v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14352v1)

2025/12/16 12:29 GTM

Dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) is essential for creating immersive experiences. Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU. It further sustains 160 FPS at 1352 * 1014 on an RTX 3050 and has been integrated into the VR system. Moreover, HGS achieves comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes.

### Towards Transferable Defense Against Malicious Image Edits
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14341v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14341v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14341v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14341v1)

Recent approaches employing imperceptible perturbations in input images have demonstrated promising potential to counter malicious manipulations in diffusion-based image editing systems. However, existing methods suffer from limited transferability in cross-model evaluations. To address this, we propose Transferable Defense Against Malicious Image Edits (TDAE), a novel bimodal framework that enhances image immunity against malicious edits through coordinated image-text optimization. Specifically, at the visual defense level, we introduce FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM), which incorporates gradient regularization into the adversarial objective. By explicitly steering the perturbations toward flat minima, FDM amplifies immune robustness against unseen editing models. For textual enhancement protection, we propose an adversarial optimization paradigm named Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD), which periodically refines text embeddings to align the editing outcomes of immunized images with those of the original images, then updates the images under optimized embeddings. Through iterative adversarial updates to diverse embeddings, DPD enforces the generation of immunized images that seek a broader set of immunity-enhancing features, thereby achieving cross-model transferability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our TDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating malicious edits under both intra- and cross-model evaluations.

### Vector Prism: Animating Vector Graphics by Stratifying Semantic Structure
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14336v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14336v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14336v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14336v1)

2025/12/16 12:03 GTM

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are central to modern web design, and the demand to animate them continues to grow as web environments become increasingly dynamic. Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.

### Dual Attention Guided Defense Against Malicious Edits
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14333v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14333v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14333v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14333v1)

2025/12/16 12:01 GTM

Recent progress in text-to-image diffusion models has transformed image editing via text prompts, yet this also introduces significant ethical challenges from potential misuse in creating deceptive or harmful content. While current defenses seek to mitigate this risk by embedding imperceptible perturbations, their effectiveness is limited against malicious tampering. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation (DANP) immunization method that adds imperceptible perturbations to disrupt the model's semantic understanding and generation process. DANP functions over multiple timesteps to manipulate both cross-attention maps and the noise prediction process, using a dynamic threshold to generate masks that identify text-relevant and irrelevant regions. It then reduces attention in relevant areas while increasing it in irrelevant ones, thereby misguides the edit towards incorrect regions and preserves the intended targets. Additionally, our method maximizes the discrepancy between the injected noise and the model's predicted noise to further interfere with the generation. By targeting both attention and noise prediction mechanisms, DANP exhibits impressive immunity against malicious edits, and extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Semantic Mismatch and Perceptual Degradation: A New Perspective on Image Editing Immunity
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14320v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14320v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14320v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14320v1)

Text-guided image editing via diffusion models, while powerful, raises significant concerns about misuse, motivating efforts to immunize images against unauthorized edits using imperceptible perturbations. Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments show our SIFM achieves the state-of-the-art performance for safeguarding visual content against malicious diffusion-based manipulation.

### From YOLO to VLMs: Advancing Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Detection of Wastewater Treatment Plants Using Satellite Imagery in MENA Region
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14312v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14312v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14312v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14312v1)

In regions of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), there is a high demand for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), crucial for sustainable water management. Precise identification of WWTPs from satellite images enables environmental monitoring. Traditional methods like YOLOv8 segmentation require extensive manual labeling. But studies indicate that vision-language models (VLMs) are an efficient alternative to achieving equivalent or superior results through inherent reasoning and annotation. This study presents a structured methodology for VLM comparison, divided into zero-shot and few-shot streams specifically to identify WWTPs. The YOLOv8 was trained on a governmental dataset of 83,566 high-resolution satellite images from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and UAE: ~85% WWTPs (positives), 15% non-WWTPs (negatives). Evaluated VLMs include LLaMA 3.2 Vision, Qwen 2.5 VL, DeepSeek-VL2, Gemma 3, Gemini, and Pixtral 12B (Mistral), used to identify WWTP components such as circular/rectangular tanks, aeration basins and distinguish confounders via expert prompts producing JSON outputs with confidence and descriptions. The dataset comprises 1,207 validated WWTP locations (198 UAE, 354 KSA, 655 Egypt) and equal non-WWTP sites from field/AI data, as 600mx600m Geo-TIFF images (Zoom 18, EPSG:4326). Zero-shot evaluations on WWTP images showed several VLMs out-performing YOLOv8's true positive rate, with Gemma-3 highest. Results confirm that VLMs, particularly with zero-shot, can replace YOLOv8 for efficient, annotation-free WWTP classification, enabling scalable remote sensing.

### PSMamba: Progressive Self-supervised Vision Mamba for Plant Disease Recognition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14309v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14309v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14309v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14309v1)

2025/12/16 11:27 GTM

Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has become a powerful paradigm for representation learning without manual annotations. However, most existing frameworks focus on global alignment and struggle to capture the hierarchical, multi-scale lesion patterns characteristic of plant disease imagery. To address this gap, we propose PSMamba, a progressive self-supervised framework that integrates the efficient sequence modelling of Vision Mamba (VM) with a dual-student hierarchical distillation strategy. Unlike conventional single teacher-student designs, PSMamba employs a shared global teacher and two specialised students: one processes mid-scale views to capture lesion distributions and vein structures, while the other focuses on local views to capture fine-grained cues such as texture irregularities and early-stage lesions. This multi-granular supervision facilitates the joint learning of contextual and detailed representations, with consistency losses ensuring coherent cross-scale alignment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that PSMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in both domain-shifted and fine-grained scenarios.

### SS4D: Native 4D Generative Model via Structured Spacetime Latents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14284v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14284v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14284v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14284v1)

2025/12/16 10:45 GTM

We present SS4D, a native 4D generative model that synthesizes dynamic 3D objects directly from monocular video. Unlike prior approaches that construct 4D representations by optimizing over 3D or video generative models, we train a generator directly on 4D data, achieving high fidelity, temporal coherence, and structural consistency. At the core of our method is a compressed set of structured spacetime latents. Specifically, (1) To address the scarcity of 4D training data, we build on a pre-trained single-image-to-3D model, preserving strong spatial consistency. (2) Temporal consistency is enforced by introducing dedicated temporal layers that reason across frames. (3) To support efficient training and inference over long video sequences, we compress the latent sequence along the temporal axis using factorized 4D convolutions and temporal downsampling blocks. In addition, we employ a carefully designed training strategy to enhance robustness against occlusion

### TUN: Detecting Significant Points in Persistence Diagrams with Deep Learning

Persistence diagrams (PDs) provide a powerful tool for understanding the topology of the underlying shape of a point cloud. However, identifying which points in PDs encode genuine signals remains challenging. This challenge directly hinders the practical adoption of topological data analysis in many applications, where automated and reliable interpretation of persistence diagrams is essential for downstream decision-making. In this paper, we study automatic significance detection for one-dimensional persistence diagrams. Specifically, we propose Topology Understanding Net (TUN), a multi-modal network that combines enhanced PD descriptors with self-attention, a PointNet-style point cloud encoder, learned fusion, and per-point classification, alongside stable preprocessing and imbalance-aware training. It provides an automated and effective solution for identifying significant points in PDs, which are critical for downstream applications. Experiments show that TUN outperforms classic methods in detecting significant points in PDs, illustrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

### Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in

Grounded video question answering (GVQA) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in videos and generate accurate answers to a given question; however, large video-language models (LVLMs) exhibit limited temporal awareness. Although existing approaches based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) attempt to improve temporal grounding, they still struggle to faithfully ground their answers in the relevant video evidence, leading to temporal mislocalization and hallucinations. In this work, we present Zoom-Zero, a coarse-to-fine framework that first localizes query-relevant segments and then temporally zooms into the most salient frames for finer-grained visual verification. Our method addresses the limits of GRPO for the GVQA task with two key innovations: (i) a zoom-in accuracy reward that validates the fidelity of temporal grounding prediction and facilitates fine-grained visual verification on grounded frames; (ii) token-selective credit assignment, which attributes rewards to the tokens responsible for temporal localization or answer generation, mitigating GRPO's issue in handling multi-faceted reward signals. Our proposed method advances grounded video question answering, improving temporal grounding by 5.2\% on NExT-GQA and 4.6\% on ReXTime, while also enhancing average answer accuracy by 2.4\%. Additionally, the coarse-to-fine zoom-in during inference further benefits long-form video understanding by preserving critical visual details without compromising global context, yielding an average improvement of 6.4\% on long-video benchmarks.

Predicting driver attention is a critical problem for developing explainable autonomous driving systems and understanding driver behavior in mixed human-autonomous vehicle traffic scenarios. Although significant progress has been made through large-scale driver attention datasets and deep learning architectures, existing works are constrained by narrow frontal field-of-view and limited driving diversity. Consequently, they fail to capture the full spatial context of driving environments, especially during lane changes, turns, and interactions involving peripheral objects such as pedestrians or cyclists. In this paper, we introduce DriverGaze360, a large-scale 360$^\circ$ field of view driver attention dataset, containing $\sim$1 million gaze-labeled frames collected from 19 human drivers, enabling comprehensive omnidirectional modeling of driver gaze behavior. Moreover, our panoramic attention prediction approach, DriverGaze360-Net, jointly learns attention maps and attended objects by employing an auxiliary semantic segmentation head. This improves spatial awareness and attention prediction across wide panoramic inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriverGaze360-Net achieves state-of-the-art attention prediction performance on multiple metrics on panoramic driving images.

### Enhancing Visual Programming for Visual Reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs

Recently, Visual Programming (VP) based on large language models (LLMs) has rapidly developed and demonstrated significant potential in complex Visual Reasoning (VR) tasks. Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.

The growing demand for immersive 3D content calls for automated monocular-to-stereo video conversion. We present Elastic3D, a controllable, direct end-to-end method for upgrading a conventional video to a binocular one. Our approach, based on (conditional) latent diffusion, avoids artifacts due to explicit depth estimation and warping. The key to its high-quality stereo video output is a novel, guided VAE decoder that ensures sharp and epipolar-consistent stereo video output. Moreover, our method gives the user control over the strength of the stereo effect (more precisely, the disparity range) at inference time, via an intuitive, scalar tuning knob. Experiments on three different datasets of real-world stereo videos show that our method outperforms both traditional warping-based and recent warping-free baselines and sets a new standard for reliable, controllable stereo video conversion.

Automotive radar has shown promising developments in environment perception due to its cost-effectiveness and robustness in adverse weather conditions. However, the limited availability of annotated radar data poses a significant challenge for advancing radar-based perception systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework to generate 4D radar point clouds for training and evaluating object detectors. Unlike image-based diffusion, our method is designed to consider the sparsity and unique characteristics of radar point clouds by applying diffusion to a latent point cloud representation. Within this latent space, generation is controlled via conditioning at either the object or scene level. The proposed 4D-RaDiff converts unlabeled bounding boxes into high-quality radar annotations and transforms existing LiDAR point cloud data into realistic radar scenes. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating synthetic radar data of 4D-RaDiff as data augmentation method during training consistently improves object detection performance compared to training on real data only. In addition, pre-training on our synthetic data reduces the amount of required annotated radar data by up to 90% while achieving comparable object detection performance.

Human communication is inherently multimodal and social: words, prosody, and body language jointly carry intent. Yet most prior systems model human behavior as a translation task co-speech gesture or text-to-motion that maps a fixed utterance to motion clips-without requiring agentic decision-making about when to move, what to do, or how to adapt across multi-turn dialogue. This leads to brittle timing, weak social grounding, and fragmented stacks where speech, text, and motion are trained or inferred in isolation. We introduce ViBES (Voice in Behavioral Expression and Synchrony), a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement and executes dialogue-conditioned body actions. Concretely, ViBES is a speech-language-behavior (SLB) model with a mixture-of-modality-experts (MoME) backbone: modality-partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion. The model processes interleaved multimodal token streams with hard routing by modality (parameters are split per expert), while sharing information through cross-expert attention. By leveraging strong pretrained speech-language models, the agent supports mixed-initiative interaction: users can speak, type, or issue body-action directives mid-conversation, and the system exposes controllable behavior hooks for streaming responses. We further benchmark on multi-turn conversation with automatic metrics of dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, and observe consistent gains over strong co-speech and text-to-motion baselines. ViBES goes beyond "speech-conditioned motion generation" toward agentic virtual bodies where language, prosody, and movement are jointly generated, enabling controllable, socially competent 3D interaction.

### Multi-View MRI Approach for Classification of MGMT Methylation in Glioblastoma Patients

The presence of MGMT promoter methylation significantly affects how well chemotherapy works for patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Currently, confirmation of MGMT promoter methylation relies on invasive brain tumor tissue biopsies. In this study, we explore radiogenomics techniques, a promising approach in precision medicine, to identify genetic markers from medical images. Using MRI scans and deep learning models, we propose a new multi-view approach that considers spatial relationships between MRI views to detect MGMT methylation status. Importantly, our method extracts information from all three views without using a complicated 3D deep learning model, avoiding issues associated with high parameter count, slow convergence, and substantial memory demands. We also introduce a new technique for tumor slice extraction and show its superiority over existing methods based on multiple evaluation metrics. By comparing our approach to state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Furthermore, we share a reproducible pipeline of published models, encouraging transparency and the development of robust diagnostic tools. Our study highlights the potential of non-invasive methods for identifying MGMT promoter methylation and contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM treatment.

### OmniGen: Unified Multimodal Sensor Generation for Autonomous Driving

Autonomous driving has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by extensive real-world data collection. However, acquiring diverse and corner-case data remains costly and inefficient. Generative models have emerged as a promising solution by synthesizing realistic sensor data. However, existing approaches primarily focus on single-modality generation, leading to inefficiencies and misalignment in multimodal sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose OminiGen, which generates aligned multimodal sensor data in a unified framework. Our approach leverages a shared Bird\u2019s Eye View (BEV) space to unify multimodal features and designs a novel generalizable multimodal reconstruction method, UAE, to jointly decode LiDAR and multi-view camera data. UAE achieves multimodal sensor decoding through volume rendering, enabling accurate and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we incorporate a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with a ControlNet branch to enable controllable multimodal sensor generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OminiGen achieves desired performances in unified multimodal sensor data generation with multimodal consistency and flexible sensor adjustments.

### History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer for Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14222v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14222v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14222v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14222v1)

Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (AVLN) requires Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agents to localize targets in large-scale urban environments based on linguistic instructions. While successful navigation demands both global environmental reasoning and local scene comprehension, existing UAV agents typically adopt mono-granularity frameworks that struggle to balance these two aspects. To address this limitation, this work proposes a History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer (HETT) framework, which integrates the two aspects through a coarse-to-fine navigation pipeline. Specifically, HETT first predicts coarse-grained target positions by fusing spatial landmarks and historical context, then refines actions via fine-grained visual analysis. In addition, a historical grid map is designed to dynamically aggregate visual features into a structured spatial memory, enhancing comprehensive scene awareness. Additionally, the CityNav dataset annotations are manually refined to enhance data quality. Experiments on the refined CityNav dataset show that HETT delivers significant performance gains, while extensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each component.

### DRAW2ACT: Turning Depth-Encoded Trajectories into Robotic Demonstration Videos

Video diffusion models provide powerful real-world simulators for embodied AI but remain limited in controllability for robotic manipulation. Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles. Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show that DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.

### Beyond a Single Light: A Large-Scale Aerial Dataset for Urban Scene Reconstruction Under Varying Illumination

Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated strong potential for large-scale UAV-based 3D reconstruction tasks by fitting the appearance of images. However, real-world large-scale captures are often based on multi-temporal data capture, where illumination inconsistencies across different times of day can significantly lead to color artifacts, geometric inaccuracies, and inconsistent appearance. Due to the lack of UAV datasets that systematically capture the same areas under varying illumination conditions, this challenge remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduceSkyLume, a large-scale, real-world UAV dataset specifically designed for studying illumination robust 3D reconstruction in urban scene modeling: (1) We collect data from 10 urban regions data comprising more than 100k high resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), where each region is captured at three periods of the day to systematically isolate illumination changes. (2) To support precise evaluation of geometry and appearance, we provide per-scene LiDAR scans and accurate 3D ground-truth for assessing depth, surface normals, and reconstruction quality under varying illumination. (3) For the inverse rendering task, we introduce the Temporal Consistency Coefficient (TCC), a metric that measuress cross-time albedo stability and directly evaluates the robustness of the disentanglement of light and material. We aim for this resource to serve as a foundation that advances research and real-world evaluation in large-scale inverse rendering, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis.

### Fracture Morphology Classification: Local Multiclass Modeling for Multilabel Complexity

Between $15\,\%$ and $45\,\%$ of children experience a fracture during their growth years, making accurate diagnosis essential. Fracture morphology, alongside location and fragment angle, is a key diagnostic feature. In this work, we propose a method to extract fracture morphology by assigning automatically global AO codes to corresponding fracture bounding boxes. This approach enables the use of public datasets and reformulates the global multilabel task into a local multiclass one, improving the average F1 score by $7.89\,\%$. However, performance declines when using imperfect fracture detectors, highlighting challenges for real-world deployment. Our code is available on GitHub.

### Establishing Stochastic Object Models from Noisy Data via Ambient Measurement-Integrated Diffusion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14187v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14187v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14187v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14187v1)

Task-based measures of image quality (IQ) are critical for evaluating medical imaging systems, which must account for randomness including anatomical variability. Stochastic object models (SOMs) provide a statistical description of such variability, but conventional mathematical SOMs fail to capture realistic anatomy, while data-driven approaches typically require clean data rarely available in clinical tasks. To address this challenge, we propose AMID, an unsupervised Ambient Measurement-Integrated Diffusion with noise decoupling, which establishes clean SOMs directly from noisy measurements. AMID introduces a measurement-integrated strategy aligning measurement noise with the diffusion trajectory, and explicitly models coupling between measurement and diffusion noise across steps, an ambient loss is thus designed base on it to learn clean SOMs. Experiments on real CT and mammography datasets show that AMID outperforms existing methods in generation fidelity and yields more reliable task-based IQ evaluation, demonstrating its potential for unsupervised medical imaging analysis.

### Spherical Voronoi: Directional Appearance as a Differentiable Partition of the Sphere
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14180v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14180v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14180v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14180v1)

2025/12/16 08:21 GTM

Radiance field methods (e.g. 3D Gaussian Splatting) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet their appearance modeling often relies on Spherical Harmonics (SH), which impose fundamental limitations. SH struggle with high-frequency signals, exhibit Gibbs ringing artifacts, and fail to capture specular reflections - a key component of realistic rendering. Although alternatives like spherical Gaussians offer improvements, they add significant optimization complexity. We propose Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive and stable parameterization for view-dependent effects. For diffuse appearance, SV achieves competitive results while keeping optimization simpler than existing alternatives. For reflections - where SH fail - we leverage SV as learnable reflection probes, taking reflected directions as input following principles from classical graphics. This formulation attains state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that SV offers a principled, efficient, and general solution for appearance modeling in explicit 3D representations.

### Improving Semantic Uncertainty Quantification in LVLMs with Semantic Gaussian Processes
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14177v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14177v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14177v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14177v1)

2025/12/16 08:15 GTM

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce plausible but unreliable outputs, making robust uncertainty estimation essential. Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. This spectral representation is then fed into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty, and that can be applied in both black-box and white-box settings. Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance. We further show that SGPU transfers across models and modalities, indicating that its spectral representation captures general patterns of semantic uncertainty.

### FastDDHPose: Towards Unified, Efficient, and Disentangled 3D Human Pose Estimation
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14162v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14162v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14162v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14162v1)

2025/12/16 07:47 GTM

Recent approaches for monocular 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) have achieved leading performance by directly regressing 3D poses from 2D keypoint sequences. Despite the rapid progress in 3D HPE, existing methods are typically trained and evaluated under disparate frameworks, lacking a unified framework for fair comparison. To address these limitations, we propose Fast3DHPE, a modular framework that facilitates rapid reproduction and flexible development of new methods. By standardizing training and evaluation protocols, Fast3DHPE enables fair comparison across 3D human pose estimation methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this framework, we introduce FastDDHPose, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method which leverages the strong latent distribution modeling capability of diffusion models to explicitly model the distributions of bone length and bone direction while avoiding further amplification of hierarchical error accumulation. Moreover, we design an efficient Kinematic-Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser that encourages the model to focus on kinematic joint hierarchies while avoiding unnecessary modeling of overly complex joint topologies. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that the Fast3DHPE framework enables fair comparison of all methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this unified framework, FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization and robustness in in-the-wild scenarios. The framework and models will be released at: https://github.com/Andyen512/Fast3DHPE

### CIS-BA: Continuous Interaction Space Based Backdoor Attack for Object Detection in the Real-World
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14158v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14158v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14158v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14158v1)

2025/12/16 07:37 GTM

Object detection models deployed in real-world applications such as autonomous driving face serious threats from backdoor attacks. Despite their practical effectiveness,existing methods are inherently limited in both capability and robustness due to their dependence on single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues. We propose CIS-BA, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that redefines trigger design by shifting from static object features to continuous inter-object interaction patterns that describe how objects co-occur and interact in a scene. By modeling these patterns as a continuous interaction space, CIS-BA introduces space triggers that, for the first time, enable a multi-trigger-multi-object attack mechanism while achieving robustness through invariant geometric relations. To implement this paradigm, we design CIS-Frame, which constructs space triggers via interaction analysis, formalizes them as class-geometry constraints for sample poisoning, and embeds the backdoor during detector training. CIS-Frame supports both single-object attacks (object misclassification and disappearance) and multi-object simultaneous attacks, enabling complex and coordinated effects across diverse interaction states. Experiments on MS-COCO and real-world videos show that CIS-BA achieves over 97% attack success under complex environments and maintains over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, while evading three state-of-the-art defenses. In summary, CIS-BA extends the landscape of backdoor attacks in interaction-intensive scenarios and provides new insights into the security of object detection systems.

### Incentivizing Tool-augmented Thinking with Images for Medical Image Analysis
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14157v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14157v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14157v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14157v1)

2025/12/16 07:37 GTM

Recent reasoning based medical MLLMs have made progress in generating step by step textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with images" through tool-integrated reasoning. Datasets, codes, and trained models will be released publicly.

### TorchTraceAP: A New Benchmark Dataset for Detecting Performance Anti-Patterns in Computer Vision Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14141v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14141v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14141v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14141v1)

2025/12/16 06:54 GTM

Identifying and addressing performance anti-patterns in machine learning (ML) models is critical for efficient training and inference, but it typically demands deep expertise spanning system infrastructure, ML models and kernel development. While large tech companies rely on dedicated ML infrastructure engineers to analyze torch traces and benchmarks, such resource-intensive workflows are largely inaccessible to computer vision researchers in general. Among the challenges, pinpointing problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces remains the most time-consuming task, and is difficult to automate with current ML models, including LLMs. In this work, we present the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate and improve ML models' ability to detect anti patterns in traces. Our dataset contains over 600 PyTorch traces from diverse computer vision models classification, detection, segmentation, and generation collected across multiple hardware platforms. We also propose a novel iterative approach: a lightweight ML model first detects trace segments with anti patterns, followed by a large language model (LLM) for fine grained classification and targeted feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule based statistical techniques for detecting anti pattern regions. Our method also effectively compensates LLM's limited context length and reasoning inefficiencies.

### SketchAssist: A Practical Assistant for Semantic Edits and Precise Local Redrawing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14140v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14140v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14140v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14140v1)

2025/12/16 06:50 GTM

Sketch editing is central to digital illustration, yet existing image editing systems struggle to preserve the sparse, style-sensitive structure of line art while supporting both high-level semantic changes and precise local redrawing. We present SketchAssist, an interactive sketch drawing assistant that accelerates creation by unifying instruction-guided global edits with line-guided region redrawing, while keeping unrelated regions and overall composition intact. To enable this assistant at scale, we introduce a controllable data generation pipeline that (i) constructs attribute-addition sequences from attribute-free base sketches, (ii) forms multi-step edit chains via cross-sequence sampling, and (iii) expands stylistic coverage with a style-preserving attribute-removal model applied to diverse sketches. Building on this data, SketchAssist employs a unified sketch editing framework with minimal changes to DiT-based editors. We repurpose the RGB channels to encode the inputs, enabling seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing within a single input interface. To further specialize behavior across modes, we integrate a task-guided mixture-of-experts into LoRA layers, routing by text and visual cues to improve semantic controllability, structural fidelity, and style preservation. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on both tasks, with superior instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to recent baselines. Together, our dataset and SketchAssist provide a practical, controllable assistant for sketch creation and revision.

### Erasing CLIP Memories: Non-Destructive, Data-Free Zero-Shot class Unlearning in CLIP Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14137v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14137v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14137v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14137v1)

2025/12/16 06:37 GTM

We introduce a novel, closed-form approach for selective unlearning in multimodal models, specifically targeting pretrained models such as CLIP. Our method leverages nullspace projection to erase the target class information embedded in the final projection layer, without requiring any retraining or the use of images from the forget set. By computing an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by target text embeddings and projecting these directions, we dramatically reduce the alignment between image features and undesired classes. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that rely on iterative fine-tuning and extensive data curation, our approach is both computationally efficient and surgically precise. This leads to a pronounced drop in zero-shot performance for the target classes while preserving the overall multimodal knowledge of the model. Our experiments demonstrate that even a partial projection can balance between complete unlearning and retaining useful information, addressing key challenges in model decontamination and privacy preservation.

### Consistent Instance Field for Dynamic Scene Understanding
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14126v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14126v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14126v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14126v1)

2025/12/16 06:12 GTM

We introduce Consistent Instance Field, a continuous and probabilistic spatio-temporal representation for dynamic scene understanding. Unlike prior methods that rely on discrete tracking or view-dependent features, our approach disentangles visibility from persistent object identity by modeling each space-time point with an occupancy probability and a conditional instance distribution. To realize this, we introduce a novel instance-embedded representation based on deformable 3D Gaussians, which jointly encode radiance and semantic information and are learned directly from input RGB images and instance masks through differentiable rasterization. Furthermore, we introduce new mechanisms to calibrate per-Gaussian identities and resample Gaussians toward semantically active regions, ensuring consistent instance representations across space and time. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on novel-view panoptic segmentation and open-vocabulary 4D querying tasks.

### SportsGPT: An LLM-driven Framework for Interpretable Sports Motion Assessment and Training Guidance
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14121v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14121v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14121v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14121v1)

2025/12/16 06:05 GTM

Existing intelligent sports analysis systems mainly focus on "scoring and visualization," often lacking automatic performance diagnosis and interpretable training guidance. Recent advances of Large Language Models (LMMs) and motion analysis techniques provide new opportunities to address the above limitations. In this paper, we propose SportsGPT, an LLM-driven framework for interpretable sports motion assessment and training guidance, which establishes a closed loop from motion time-series input to professional training guidance. First, given a set of high-quality target models, we introduce MotionDTW, a two-stage time series alignment algorithm designed for accurate keyframe extraction from skeleton-based motion sequences. Subsequently, we design a Knowledge-based Interpretable Sports Motion Assessment Model (KISMAM) to obtain a set of interpretable assessment metrics (e.g., insufficient extension) by constrasting the keyframes with the targe models. Finally, we propose SportsRAG, a RAG-based training guidance model based on Qwen3. Leveraging a 6B-token knowledge base, it prompts the LLM to generate professional training guidance by retrieving domain-specific QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that MotionDTW significantly outperforms traditional methods with lower temporal error and higher IoU scores. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the KISMAM and SportsRAG, confirming that SportsGPT surpasses general LLMs in diagnostic accuracy and professionalism.

### MFE-GAN: Efficient GAN-based Framework for Document Image Enhancement and Binarization with Multi-scale Feature Extraction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14114v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14114v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14114v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14114v1)

2025/12/16 05:54 GTM

Document image enhancement and binarization are commonly performed prior to document analysis and recognition tasks for improving the efficiency and accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. This is because directly recognizing text in degraded documents, particularly in color images, often results in unsatisfactory recognition performance. To address these issues, existing methods train independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for different color channels to remove shadows and noise, which, in turn, facilitates efficient text information extraction. However, deploying multiple GANs results in long training and inference times. To reduce both training and inference times of document image enhancement and binarization models, we propose MFE-GAN, an efficient GAN-based framework with multi-scale feature extraction (MFE), which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation (HWT) and normalization to process document images before feeding them into GANs for training. In addition, we present novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance, and we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate their effectiveness. Experimental results on the Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets demonstrate that the proposed MFE-GAN significantly reduces the total training and inference times while maintaining comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The implementation of this work is available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/MFE-GAN.

### Selective, Controlled and Domain-Agnostic Unlearning in Pretrained CLIP: A Training- and Data-Free Approach
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14113v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14113v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14113v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14113v1)

2025/12/16 05:54 GTM

Pretrained models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across diverse visual domains, spanning natural images, artistic renderings, and abstract representations. However, real-world applications often demand the removal (or "unlearning") of specific object classes without requiring additional data or retraining, or affecting the model's performance on unrelated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing retraining-based methods and offers a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting.

### Neurosymbolic Inference On Foundation Models For Remote Sensing Text-to-image Retrieval With Complex Queries
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14102v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14102v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14102v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14102v1)

2025/12/16 05:33 GTM

Text-to-image retrieval in remote sensing (RS) has advanced rapidly with the rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) tailored for aerial and satellite imagery, culminating in remote sensing large vision-language models (RS-LVLMS). However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty. RUNE outperforms joint-embedding models in complex RS retrieval tasks, offering gains in performance, robustness, and explainability. We show RUNE's potential for real-world RS applications through a use case on post-flood satellite image retrieval.

### ViewMask-1-to-3: Multi-View Consistent Image Generation via Multimodal Diffusion Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14099v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14099v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14099v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14099v1)

Multi-view image generation from a single image and text description remains challenging due to the difficulty of maintaining geometric consistency across different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically rely on 3D-aware architectures or specialized diffusion models that require extensive multi-view training data and complex geometric priors. In this work, we introduce ViewMask-1-to-3, a pioneering approach to apply discrete diffusion models to multi-view image generation. Unlike continuous diffusion methods that operate in latent spaces, ViewMask-1-to-3 formulates multi-view synthesis as a discrete sequence modeling problem, where each viewpoint is represented as visual tokens obtained through MAGVIT-v2 tokenization. By unifying language and vision through masked token prediction, our approach enables progressive generation of multiple viewpoints through iterative token unmasking with text input. ViewMask-1-to-3 achieves cross-view consistency through simple random masking combined with self-attention, eliminating the requirement for complex 3D geometric constraints or specialized attention architectures. Our approach demonstrates that discrete diffusion provides a viable and simple alternative to existing multi-view generation methods, ranking first on average across GSO and 3D-FUTURE datasets in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, while maintaining architectural simplicity.

### OUSAC: Optimized Guidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching for DiT Acceleration

Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance. Experiments demonstrate that OUSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, achieving 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.

### TimeLens: Rethinking Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs

This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

### MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning

Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.

### Spoken DialogSum: An Emotion-Rich Conversational Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Summarization
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14687v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14687v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14687v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14687v1)

Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.

### Fast and Accurate Causal Parallel Decoding using Jacobi Forcing
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14681v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14681v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14681v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14681v1)

Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

### Segmental Attention Decoding With Long Form Acoustic Encodings
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14652v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14652v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14652v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14652v1)

We address the fundamental incompatibility of attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models with long-form acoustic encodings. AED models trained on segmented utterances learn to encode absolute frame positions by exploiting limited acoustic context beyond segment boundaries, but fail to generalize when decoding long-form segments where these cues vanish. The model loses ability to order acoustic encodings due to permutation invariance of keys and values in cross-attention. We propose four modifications: (1) injecting explicit absolute positional encodings into cross-attention for each decoded segment, (2) long-form training with extended acoustic context to eliminate implicit absolute position encoding, (3) segment concatenation to cover diverse segmentations needed during training, and (4) semantic segmentation to align AED-decoded segments with training segments. We show these modifications close the accuracy gap between continuous and segmented acoustic encodings, enabling auto-regressive use of the attention decoder.

### TiME: Tiny Monolingual Encoders for Efficient NLP Pipelines
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14645v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14645v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14645v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14645v1)

Today, a lot of research on language models is focused on large, general-purpose models. However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.

### JMMMU-Pro: Image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark via Vibe Benchmark Construction
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14620v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14620v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14620v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14620v1)

2025/12/16 17:33 GTM

This paper introduces JMMMU-Pro, an image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark, and Vibe Benchmark Construction, a scalable construction method. Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.

### Towards Nepali-language LLMs: Efficient GPT training with a Nepali BPE tokenizer
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14585v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14585v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14585v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14585v1)

Nepali, a low-resource language spoken by over 32 million people, continues to face challenges in natural language processing (NLP) due to its complex grammar, agglutinative morphology, and limited availability of high-quality corpora. Most efforts to date have centered on basic encoder architectures; they remain insufficient for Nepali-specific text generation. This study presents a GPT-2-based Nepali language model trained using several training strategies inspired by GPT-3, including optimized learning rate schedules, batch scaling, and architectural refinements. A custom 16k Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer was trained exclusively on Nepali text to ensure more consistent segmentation and improved input representation. The model was pretrained on a combined dataset comprising a 10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus and additional web-scraped Nepali news articles. FlashAttention was integrated to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. After two epochs, the model achieved a training loss of 3.168177, a validation loss of 3.081982, and a final perplexity of 21.80, demonstrating its capability to generate coherent Nepali news-style text.

The tutorial presents strategies for tackling the challenges of data scarcity and cultural variance, offering hands-on methods and modeling frameworks. We will focus on fair, reproducible, and community-informed development approaches, grounded in real-world scenarios. We will showcase a diverse set of use cases covering over 10 languages from different language families and geopolitical contexts, including both digitally resource-rich and severely underrepresented languages.

### Polypersona: Persona-Grounded LLM for Synthetic Survey Responses

This paper introduces PolyPersona, a generative framework for synthesizing persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains. The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols.

### Agreement Between Large Language Models and Human Raters in Essay Scoring: A Research Synthesis

2025/12/16 16:33 GTM

Despite the growing promise of large language models (LLMs) in automatic essay scoring (AES), empirical findings regarding their reliability compared to human raters remain mixed. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we synthesized 65 published and unpublished studies from January 2022 to August 2025 that examined agreement between LLMs and human raters in AES. Across studies, reported LLM-human agreement was generally moderate to good, with agreement indices (e.g., Quadratic Weighted Kappa, Pearson correlation, and Spearman's rho) mostly ranging between 0.30 and 0.80. Substantial variability in agreement levels was observed across studies, reflecting differences in study-specific factors as well as the lack of standardized reporting practices. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

### VLegal-Bench: Cognitively Grounded Benchmark for Vietnamese Legal Reasoning of Large Language Models

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.

### Dual Language Models: Balancing Training Efficiency and Overfitting Resilience
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14549v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14549v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14549v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14549v1)

This paper combines autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives without any architectural modifications, resulting in flexible language models that outperform single-objective models. Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.

### VersatileFFN: Achieving Parameter Efficiency in LLMs via Adaptive Wide-and-Deep Reuse

The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance, but it also leads to prohibitive memory costs. Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering "easy" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to "hard" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/VersatileFFN.

### Linguists should learn to love speech-based deep learning models

2025/12/16 15:42 GTM

Futrell and Mahowald present a useful framework bridging technology-oriented deep learning systems and explanation-oriented linguistic theories. Unfortunately, the target article's focus on generative text-based LLMs fundamentally limits fruitful interactions with linguistics, as many interesting questions on human language fall outside what is captured by written text. We argue that audio-based deep learning models can and should play a crucial role.

### RecGPT-V2 Technical Report
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14503v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14503v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14503v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14503v1)

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning. While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.
  To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER. RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.

### C-ing Clearly: Enhanced Binary Code Explanations using C code

2025/12/16 15:36 GTM

Large Language Models (LLMs) typically excel at coding tasks involving high-level programming languages, as opposed to lower-level programming languages, such as assembly. We propose a synthetic data generation method named C-ing Clearly, which leverages the corresponding C code to enhance an LLM's understanding of assembly. By fine-tuning on data generated through our method, we demonstrate improved LLM performance for binary code summarization and vulnerability detection. Our approach demonstrates consistent gains across different LLM families and model sizes.

### SASQ: Static Activation Scaling for Quantization-Aware Training in Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14481v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14481v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14481v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14481v1)

Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but face deployment challenges due to their growing size outpacing GPU memory advancements. Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.

The standard practice for training large language models involves packing multiple documents together to optimize computational efficiency. However, the impact of this process on the models' capabilities remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how different document-packing strategies influence the latent multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings indicate that packing can improve model performance compared to training on individual documents, at the expense of more compute. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we conduct an ablation study, identifying key factors that explain the advantages of packing. Ultimately, our research deepens the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development.

### RePo: Language Models with Context Re-Positioning

In-context learning is fundamental to modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, prevailing architectures impose a rigid and fixed contextual structure by assigning linear or constant positional indices. Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_φ$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

### Step-Tagging: Toward controlling the generation of Language Reasoning Models through step monitoring

The field of Language Reasoning Models (LRMs) has been very active over the past few years with advances in training and inference techniques enabling LRMs to reason longer, and more accurately. However, a growing body of studies show that LRMs are still inefficient, over-generating verification and reflection steps. To address this challenge, we introduce the Step-Tagging framework, a lightweight sentence-classifier enabling real-time annotation of the type of reasoning steps that an LRM is generating. To monitor reasoning behaviors, we introduced ReasonType: a novel taxonomy of reasoning steps. Building on this framework, we demonstrated that online monitoring of the count of specific steps can produce effective interpretable early stopping criteria of LRM inferences. We evaluate the Step-tagging framework on three open-source reasoning models across standard benchmark datasets: MATH500, GSM8K, AIME and non-mathematical tasks (GPQA and MMLU-Pro). We achieve 20 to 50\% token reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy to standard generation, with largest gains observed on more computation-heavy tasks. This work offers a novel way to increase control over the generation of LRMs, and a new tool to study behaviors of LRMs.

### Inflation Attitudes of Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14306v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14306v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14306v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14306v1)

This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo (GPT), to form inflation perceptions and expectations based on macroeconomic price signals. We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.

### SPARQL-LLM: Real-Time SPARQL Query Generation from Natural Language Questions
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14277v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14277v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14277v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14277v1)

The advent of large language models is contributing to the emergence of novel approaches that promise to better tackle the challenge of generating structured queries, such as SPARQL queries, from natural language. However, these new approaches mostly focus on response accuracy over a single source while ignoring other evaluation criteria, such as federated query capability over distributed data stores, as well as runtime and cost to generate SPARQL queries. Consequently, they are often not production-ready or easy to deploy over (potentially federated) knowledge graphs with good accuracy. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we extend our previous work and describe and systematically evaluate SPARQL-LLM, an open-source and triplestore-agnostic approach, powered by lightweight metadata, that generates SPARQL queries from natural language text. First, we describe its architecture, which consists of dedicated components for metadata indexing, prompt building, and query generation and execution. Then, we evaluate it based on a state-of-the-art challenge with multilingual questions, and a collection of questions from three of the most prevalent knowledge graphs within the field of bioinformatics. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase of 24% in the F1 Score on the state-of-the-art challenge, adaptability to high-resource languages such as English and Spanish, as well as ability to form complex and federated bioinformatics queries. Furthermore, we show that SPARQL-LLM is up to 36x faster than other systems participating in the challenge, while costing a maximum of $0.01 per question, making it suitable for real-time, low-cost text-to-SPARQL applications. One such application deployed over real-world decentralized knowledge graphs can be found at https://www.expasy.org/chat.

### From Context to EDUs: Faithful and Structured Context Compression via Elementary Discourse Unit Decomposition
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14244v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14244v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14244v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14244v1)

Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.

### Two CFG Nahuatl for automatic corpora expansion
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14239v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14239v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14239v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14239v1)

The aim of this article is to introduce two Context-Free Grammars (CFG) for Nawatl Corpora expansion. Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $π$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.

### Ladder Up, Memory Down: Low-Cost Fine-Tuning With Side Nets
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14237v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14237v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14237v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14237v1)

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is often limited by the memory available on commodity GPUs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as QLoRA reduce the number of trainable parameters, yet still incur high memory usage induced by the backward pass in the full model. We revisit Ladder Side Tuning (LST), a rarely explored PEFT technique that adds a lightweight side network, and show that it matches QLoRA's compute scaling slope while cutting peak memory by 50\%. Across different downstream benchmarks spanning natural language understanding, mathematical and LLM-critic tasks, LST has competitive performance with QLoRA's accuracy on average while being much more memory-efficient. This efficiency enables fine-tuning of 7B-parameter models on a single 12 GB consumer GPU with 2k-token contexts, requiring no gradient checkpointing\textemdash conditions under which QLoRA exhausts memory. Beyond memory efficiency, we also establish scaling laws showing that LST scales similarly to QLoRA. We exploit Ladder's architectural flexibility by introducing xLadder, a depth-extended variant that increases effective depth via cross-connections and shortens chain-of-thought (CoT) at fixed parameter count. Ladder is strong when memory is the bottleneck; xLadder builds on this by enabling deeper reasoning without additional memory overhead.

### A Comparative Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Techniques for Bengali Standard-to-Dialect Machine Translation Using LLMs
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14179v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14179v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14179v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14179v1)

Translating from a standard language to its regional dialects is a significant NLP challenge due to scarce data and linguistic variation, a problem prominent in the Bengali language. This paper proposes and compares two novel RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation. The first, a Transcript-Based Pipeline, uses large dialect sentence contexts from audio transcripts. The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\_dialect:standard\_bengali sentence pairs. We evaluated both pipelines across six Bengali dialects and multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore. Our findings show that the sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperforms the transcript-based one, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76\% to 55\% for the Chittagong dialect. Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity.

### Astraea: A State-Aware Scheduling Engine for LLM-Powered Agents
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14142v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14142v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14142v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14142v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.

### CogMem: A Cognitive Memory Architecture for Sustained Multi-Turn Reasoning in Large Language Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14118v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14118v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14118v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14118v1)

2025/12/16 06:01 GTM

Large language models (LLMs) excel at single-turn reasoning but often lose accuracy and coherence over extended, multi-turn interactions. Recent evaluations such as TurnBench highlight recurring failure modes-reasoning bias, task drift, hallucination, overconfidence, and memory decay. Current approaches typically append full conversational histories, causing unbounded context growth, higher computational costs, and degraded reasoning efficiency. We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn. Experiments on TurnBench show that this layered design mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.

### CRISP: Contact-Guided Real2Sim from Monocular Video with Planar Scene Primitives
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14696v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14696v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14696v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14696v1)

2025/12/16 18:59 GTM

We introduce CRISP, a method that recovers simulatable human motion and scene geometry from monocular video. Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\% to 6.9\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos. This demonstrates CRISP's ability to generate physically-valid human motion and interaction environments at scale, greatly advancing real-to-sim applications for robotics and AR/VR.

### CHIP: Adaptive Compliance for Humanoid Control through Hindsight Perturbation

Recent progress in humanoid robots has unlocked agile locomotion skills, including backflipping, running, and crawling. Yet it remains challenging for a humanoid robot to perform forceful manipulation tasks such as moving objects, wiping, and pushing a cart. We propose adaptive Compliance Humanoid control through hIsight Perturbation (CHIP), a plug-and-play module that enables controllable end-effector stiffness while preserving agile tracking of dynamic reference motions. CHIP is easy to implement and requires neither data augmentation nor additional reward tuning. We show that a generalist motion-tracking controller trained with CHIP can perform a diverse set of forceful manipulation tasks that require different end-effector compliance, such as multi-robot collaboration, wiping, box delivery, and door opening.

### EVOLVE-VLA: Test-Time Training from Environment Feedback for Vision-Language-Action Models
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14666v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14666v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14666v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14666v1)

Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.

### Nonlinear System Identification Nano-drone Benchmark

2025/12/16 14:37 GTM

We introduce a benchmark for system identification based on 75k real-world samples from the Crazyflie 2.1 Brushless nano-quadrotor, a sub-50g aerial vehicle widely adopted in robotics research. The platform presents a challenging testbed due to its multi-input, multi-output nature, open-loop instability, and nonlinear dynamics under agile maneuvers. The dataset comprises four aggressive trajectories with synchronized 4-dimensional motor inputs and 13-dimensional output measurements. To enable fair comparison of identification methods, the benchmark includes a suite of multi-horizon prediction metrics for evaluating both one-step and multi-step error propagation. In addition to the data, we provide a detailed description of the platform and experimental setup, as well as baseline models highlighting the challenge of accurate prediction under real-world noise and actuation nonlinearities. All data, scripts, and reference implementations are released as open-source at https://github.com/idsia-robotics/nanodrone-sysid-benchmark to facilitate transparent comparison of algorithms and support research on agile, miniaturized aerial robotics.

### A4-Agent: An Agentic Framework for Zero-Shot Affordance Reasoning
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14442v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14442v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14442v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14442v1)

2025/12/16 14:27 GTM

Affordance prediction, which identifies interaction regions on objects based on language instructions, is critical for embodied AI. Prevailing end-to-end models couple high-level reasoning and low-level grounding into a single monolithic pipeline and rely on training over annotated datasets, which leads to poor generalization on novel objects and unseen environments. In this paper, we move beyond this paradigm by proposing A4-Agent, a training-free agentic framework that decouples affordance prediction into a three-stage pipeline. Our framework coordinates specialized foundation models at test time: (1) a $\textbf{Dreamer}$ that employs generative models to visualize $\textit{how}$ an interaction would look; (2) a $\textbf{Thinker}$ that utilizes large vision-language models to decide $\textit{what}$ object part to interact with; and (3) a $\textbf{Spotter}$ that orchestrates vision foundation models to precisely locate $\textit{where}$ the interaction area is. By leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained models without any task-specific fine-tuning, our zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings.

### Geometric Parameter Optimization of a Novel 3-(PP(2-(UPS))) Redundant Parallel Mechanism based on Workspace Determination
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14434v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14434v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14434v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14434v1)

2025/12/16 14:22 GTM

Redundant parallel robots are normally employed in scenarios requiring good precision, high load capability, and large workspace compared to traditional parallel mechanisms. However, the elementary robotic configuration and geometric parameter optimization are still quite challenging. This paper proposes a novel 3-(PP(2-(UPS))) redundant parallel mechanism, with good generalizability first, and further investigates the kinematic optimization issue by analyzing and investigating how its key geometric parameters influence the volume, shape, boundary completeness, and orientation capabilities of its workspace. The torsional capability index TI_1 and tilting capability index TI_2 are defined to evaluate the orientation performance of the mechanism. Numerical simulation studies are completed to indicate the analysis, providing reasonable but essential references for the parameter optimization of 3-(PP(2-(UPS))) and other similar redundant parallel mechanisms.

### Odyssey: An Automotive Lidar-Inertial Odometry Dataset for GNSS-denied situations
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14428v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14428v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14428v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14428v1)

2025/12/16 14:17 GTM

The development and evaluation of Lidar-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems requires a precise ground truth. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is often used as a foundation for this, but its signals can be unreliable in obstructed environments due to multi-path effects or loss-of-signal. While existing datasets compensate for the sporadic loss of GNSS signals by incorporating Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements, the commonly used Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG)-based systems do not permit the prolonged study of GNSS-denied environments. To close this gap, we present Odyssey, a LIO dataset with a focus on GNSS-denied environments such as tunnels and parking garages as well as other underrepresented, yet ubiquitous situations such as stop-and-go-traffic, bumpy roads and wide open fields. Our ground truth is derived from a navigation-grade Inertial Navigation System (INS) equipped with a Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG), offering exceptional bias stability characteristics compared to IMUs used in existing datasets and enabling the prolonged and accurate study of GNSS-denied environments. This makes Odyssey the first publicly available dataset featuring a RLG-based INS. Besides providing data for LIO, we also support other tasks, such as place recognition, through the threefold repetition of all trajectories as well as the integration of external mapping data by providing precise geodetic coordinates. All data, dataloader and other material is available online at https://odyssey.uni-goettingen.de/ .

### Quadratic Kalman Filter for Elliptical Extended Object Tracking based on Decoupling State Components
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14426v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14426v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14426v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14426v1)

2025/12/16 14:15 GTM

Extended object tracking involves estimating both the physical extent and kinematic parameters of a target object, where typically multiple measurements are observed per time step. In this article, we propose a deterministic closed-form elliptical extended object tracker, based on decoupling of the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths. By disregarding potential correlations between these state components, fewer approximations are required for the individual estimators than for an overall joint solution. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. This is validated both by a simulation study using common models from literature, as well as an extensive quantitative evaluation on real automotive radar data.

### Synthetic Data Pipelines for Adaptive, Mission-Ready Militarized Humanoids

2025/12/16 13:54 GTM

Omnia presents a synthetic data driven pipeline to accelerate the training, validation, and deployment readiness of militarized humanoids. The approach converts first-person spatial observations captured from point-of-view recordings, smart glasses, augmented reality headsets, and spatial browsing workflows into scalable, mission-specific synthetic datasets for humanoid autonomy. By generating large volumes of high-fidelity simulated scenarios and pairing them with automated labeling and model training, the pipeline enables rapid iteration on perception, navigation, and decision-making capabilities without the cost, risk, or time constraints of extensive field trials. The resulting datasets can be tuned quickly for new operational environments and threat conditions, supporting both baseline humanoid performance and advanced subsystems such as multimodal sensing, counter-detection survivability, and CBRNE-relevant reconnaissance behaviors. This work targets faster development cycles and improved robustness in complex, contested settings by exposing humanoid systems to broad scenario diversity early in the development process.

### A Comprehensive Safety Metric to Evaluate Perception in Autonomous Systems
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14367v1) [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.14367v1) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14367v1) [kimi](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2512.14367v1)

2025/12/16 12:53 GTM

Complete perception of the environment and its correct interpretation is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Object perception is the main component of automotive surround sensing. Various metrics already exist for the evaluation of object perception. However, objects can be of different importance depending on their velocity, orientation, distance, size, or the potential damage that could be caused by a collision due to a missed detection. Thus, these additional parameters have to be considered for safety evaluation. We propose a new safety metric that incorporates all these parameters and returns a single easily interpretable safety assessment score for object perception. This new metric is evaluated with both real world and virtual data sets and compared to state of the art metrics.

### CoLD Fusion: A Real-time Capable Spline-based Fusion Algorithm for Collective Lane Detection

Comprehensive environment perception is essential for autonomous vehicles to operate safely. It is crucial to detect both dynamic road users and static objects like traffic signs or lanes as these are required for safe motion planning. However, in many circumstances a complete perception of other objects or lanes is not achievable due to limited sensor ranges, occlusions, and curves. In scenarios where an accurate localization is not possible or for roads where no HD maps are available, an autonomous vehicle must rely solely on its perceived road information. Thus, extending local sensing capabilities through collective perception using vehicle-to-vehicle communication is a promising strategy that has not yet been explored for lane detection. Therefore, we propose a real-time capable approach for collective perception of lanes using a spline-based estimation of undetected road sections. We evaluate our proposed fusion algorithm in various situations and road types. We were able to achieve real-time capability and extend the perception range by up to 200%.

Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.

### A Geometric Task-Space Port-Hamiltonian Formulation for Redundant Manipulators

We present a novel geometric port-Hamiltonian formulation of redundant manipulators performing a differential kinematic task $η=J(q)\dot{q}$, where $q$ is a point on the configuration manifold, $η$ is a velocity-like task space variable, and $J(q)$ is a linear map representing the task, for example the classical analytic or geometric manipulator Jacobian matrix. The proposed model emerges from a change of coordinates from canonical Hamiltonian dynamics, and splits the standard Hamiltonian momentum variable into a task-space momentum variable and a null-space momentum variable. Properties of this model and relation to Lagrangian formulations present in the literature are highlighted. Finally, we apply the proposed model in an \textit{Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control} (IDA-PBC) design to stabilize and shape the impedance of a 7-DOF Emika Panda robot in simulation.

The interest in the usage of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) for forest applications has increased in recent years. While above-canopy flight has reached a high level of autonomy, navigating under-canopy remains a significant challenge. The use of autonomous UAVs could reduce the burden of data collection, which has motivated the development of numerous solutions for under-canopy autonomous flight. However, the experiments conducted in the literature and their reporting lack rigor. Very rarely, the density and the difficulty of the test forests are reported, or multiple flights are flown, and the success rate of those flights is reported. The aim of this study was to implement an autonomously flying quadrotor based on a lightweight lidar using openly available algorithms and test its behavior in real forest environments. A set of rigorous experiments was conducted with a quadrotor prototype utilizing the IPC path planner and LTA-OM SLAM algorithm. Based on the results of the first 33 flights, the original system was further enhanced. With the optimized system, 60 flights were performed, resulting in a total of 93 test flights. The optimized system performed significantly better in terms of reliability and flight mission completion times, achieving success rates of 12/15 in a medium-density forest and 15/15 in a dense forest, at a target flight velocity of 1 m/s. At a target flight velocity of 2 m/s, it had a success rate of 12/15 and 5/15, respectively. Furthermore, a standardized testing setup and evaluation criteria were proposed, enabling consistent performance comparisons of autonomous under-canopy UAV systems, enhancing reproducibility, guiding system improvements, and accelerating progress in forest robotics.

Real-world robots must operate under evolving dynamics caused by changing operating conditions, external disturbances, and unmodeled effects. These may appear as gradual drifts, transient fluctuations, or abrupt shifts, demanding real-time adaptation that is robust to short-term variation yet responsive to lasting change. We propose a framework for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of robotic systems that can be updated in real time from streaming data. The method decouples representation learning from online adaptation, using latent representations learned offline to support online closed-form Bayesian updates. To handle evolving conditions, we introduce a changepoint-aware mechanism with a latent variable inferred from data likelihoods that indicates continuity or shift. When continuity is likely, evidence accumulates to refine predictions; when a shift is detected, past information is tempered to enable rapid re-learning. This maintains calibrated uncertainty and supports probabilistic reasoning about transient, gradual, or structural change. We prove that the adaptive regret of the framework grows only logarithmically in time and linearly with the number of shifts, competitive with an oracle that knows timings of shift. We validate on cartpole simulations and real quadrotor flights with swinging payloads and mid-flight drops, showing improved predictive accuracy, faster recovery, and more accurate closed-loop tracking than relevant baselines.

### CaFe-TeleVision: A Coarse-to-Fine Teleoperation System with Immersive Situated Visualization for Enhanced Ergonomics

Teleoperation presents a promising paradigm for remote control and robot proprioceptive data collection. Despite recent progress, current teleoperation systems still suffer from limitations in efficiency and ergonomics, particularly in challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose CaFe-TeleVision, a coarse-to-fine teleoperation system with immersive situated visualization for enhanced ergonomics. At its core, a coarse-to-fine control mechanism is proposed in the retargeting module to bridge workspace disparities, jointly optimizing efficiency and physical ergonomics. To stream immersive feedback with adequate visual cues for human vision systems, an on-demand situated visualization technique is integrated in the perception module, which reduces the cognitive load for multi-view processing. The system is built on a humanoid collaborative robot and validated with six challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. User study among 24 participants confirms that CaFe-TeleVision enhances ergonomics with statistical significance, indicating a lower task load and a higher user acceptance during teleoperation. Quantitative results also validate the superior performance of our system across six tasks, surpassing comparative methods by up to 28.89% in success rate and accelerating by 26.81% in completion time.

### History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer for Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation

Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (AVLN) requires Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agents to localize targets in large-scale urban environments based on linguistic instructions. While successful navigation demands both global environmental reasoning and local scene comprehension, existing UAV agents typically adopt mono-granularity frameworks that struggle to balance these two aspects. To address this limitation, this work proposes a History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer (HETT) framework, which integrates the two aspects through a coarse-to-fine navigation pipeline. Specifically, HETT first predicts coarse-grained target positions by fusing spatial landmarks and historical context, then refines actions via fine-grained visual analysis. In addition, a historical grid map is designed to dynamically aggregate visual features into a structured spatial memory, enhancing comprehensive scene awareness. Additionally, the CityNav dataset annotations are manually refined to enhance data quality. Experiments on the refined CityNav dataset show that HETT delivers significant performance gains, while extensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each component.

### DRAW2ACT: Turning Depth-Encoded Trajectories into Robotic Demonstration Videos

Video diffusion models provide powerful real-world simulators for embodied AI but remain limited in controllability for robotic manipulation. Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles. Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show that DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.

### Trajectory Tracking for Multi-Manipulator Systems in Constrained Environments

We consider the problem of cooperative manipulation by a mobile multi-manipulator system operating in obstacle-cluttered and highly constrained environments under spatio-temporal task specifications. The task requires transporting a grasped object while respecting both continuous robot dynamics and discrete geometric constraints arising from obstacles and narrow passages. To address this hybrid structure, we propose a multi-rate planning and control framework that combines offline generation of an STL-satisfying object trajectory and collision-free base footprints with online constrained inverse kinematics and continuous-time feedback control. The resulting closed-loop system enables coordinated reconfiguration of multiple manipulators while tracking the desired object motion. The approach is evaluated in high-fidelity physics simulations using three Franka Emika Panda mobile manipulators rigidly grasping an object.

### SUPER -- A Framework for Sensitivity-based Uncertainty-aware Performance and Risk Assessment in Visual Inertial Odometry

While many visual odometry (VO), visual-inertial odometry (VIO), and SLAM systems achieve high accuracy, the majority of existing methods miss to assess risks at runtime. This paper presents SUPER (Sensitivity-based Uncertainty-aware PErformance and Risk assessment) that is a generic and explainable framework that propagates uncertainties via sensitivities for real-time risk assessment in VIO. The scientific novelty lies in the derivation of a real-time risk indicator that is backend-agnostic and exploits the Schur complement blocks of the Gauss-Newton normal matrix to propagate uncertainties. Practically, the Schur complement captures the sensitivity that reflects the influence of the uncertainty on the risk occurrence. Our framework estimates risks on the basis of the residual magnitudes, geometric conditioning, and short horizon temporal trends without requiring ground truth knowledge. Our framework enables to reliably predict trajectory degradation 50 frames ahead with an improvement of 20% to the baseline. In addition, SUPER initiates a stop or relocalization policy with 89.1% recall. The framework is backend agnostic and operates in real time with less than 0.2% additional CPU cost. Experiments show that SUPER provides consistent uncertainty estimates. A SLAM evaluation highlights the applicability to long horizon mapping.

### Interactive Motion Planning for Human-Robot Collaboration Based on Human-Centric Configuration Space Ergonomic Field

Industrial human-robot collaboration requires motion planning that is collision-free, responsive, and ergonomically safe to reduce fatigue and musculoskeletal risk. We propose the Configuration Space Ergonomic Field (CSEF), a continuous and differentiable field over the human joint space that quantifies ergonomic quality and provides gradients for real-time ergonomics-aware planning. An efficient algorithm constructs CSEF from established metrics with joint-wise weighting and task conditioning, and we integrate it into a gradient-based planner compatible with impedance-controlled robots. In a 2-DoF benchmark, CSEF-based planning achieves higher success rates, lower ergonomic cost, and faster computation than a task-space ergonomic planner. Hardware experiments with a dual-arm robot in unimanual guidance, collaborative drilling, and bimanual cocarrying show faster ergonomic cost reduction, closer tracking to optimized joint targets, and lower muscle activation than a point-to-point baseline. CSEF-based planning method reduces average ergonomic scores by up to 10.31% for collaborative drilling tasks and 5.60% for bimanual co-carrying tasks while decreasing activation in key muscle groups, indicating practical benefits for real-world deployment.
